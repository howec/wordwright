the wind We even forgot our own name  Gollum Gollum Gollum and we wept precious We wept to be so alone  Not before Mr Frodos had something to eat  No time to lose silly Come on Must go No time And Ive gone and had too much It must be getting late  No it isnt It isnt midday yet The days are growing darker  Here  What about you  Oh no Im not hungry leastways not for lembas bread  Sam Aragorn Now come

maruvan ar Hildinyar tenn Ambarmetta Hannon le   My friends you bow to noone   And thus it was a Fourth Age of Middle Earth began And the Fellowship of the Ring though eternally bound by friendship and love was ended Thirteen months to the day since Gandalf sent us on our long journey we find ourselves looking upon a familiar sight  Alright We were home  Hey watch the pumpkin  The journey home  Oh alright but we dont have that much left We have to be careful or we are going to run out You go ahead and eat that Mr Frodo Ive rationed it there should be enough  Come Hobbitses very close now Very close to Mordor No safe places here Hurry  Its good Definitely from the Shire Longbottom leaf eh  uhh huh I feel like Im back at the Green Dragon  Mmmm Green Dragon  For what  Goodnight lads  Welcome my lords to Isengard  You young rascals A merry hunt youve led us on and now we find you feasting and and smoking Hmm  Only youve never done a hard days work  Ahaha  How do you pick up the threads of an old life How do you go on when in your heart you begin to understand there is no going back There are some things that time cannot mend Some hurts that go too deep that have taken hold  Mr Frodo What is it  Its been four years to the day since Weathertop Sam Its never really healed  A mug of ale in my hand Putting my feet up on a settle after a hard days work   There and Back Again a Hobbits tale by Bilbo Baggins and the Lord of the Rings by Frodo Baggins You finished it  Not quite Theres room for a little more   Bilbo once told me his part in this tale would end That each of us must come and go in the telling Bilbos story was now over There would be no more journeys for him save one  To the harbour Bilbo The elves have accorded you a special honour A place on the last ship to leave Middle Earth  Salted pork Hobbits Were under orders from Treebeard whos taken over management of Isengard   Tell me again lad where are we going   Frodo any chance of seeing that old Ring of mine again The one I gave you  Hoooom young master Gandalf Im glad youve come Wood and water stock and stone I can master but there is a Wizard to manage here locked in his tower   We are sitting on a field of victory enjoying a few well earned comforts The salted pork is particularly good   Show yourself  Well then lets just have his head and be done with it  Be careful Even in defeat Saruman is dangerous  You have fought many wars and slain many men Theoden King and made peace afterwards Can we not take counsel together as we once did my old friend Can we not have peace you and I  We shall have peace We shall have peace when you answer for the burning of the Westfold and the children that lie dead there We shall have peace when the lives of the soldiers whose bodies were hewn even as they lay dead against the gates of the Hornburg are avenged When you hang from a gibbet for the sport of your own crows we shall have peace Gibbets and crows Dotard What do you want Gandalf Grahame Let me guess the key of Orthanc Or perhaps the keys of Barad Dr itself Along with the crowns of the seven Kings and the rods of the Five Wizards No we need him alive We need him to talk  Im sorry uncle Im afraid I lost it  Your treachery has already cost many lives Thousands more are now at risk But you could save them Saruman You were deep in the enemys counsel  I Aear cn ven na mar  I think Im quite ready for another adventure   Farewell my brave Hobbits My work is now finished Here at last on the shores of the sea comes the end of our Fellowship I will not say do not weep for not all tears are an evil It is time Frodo  What does he mean  Oh Well here is a sight I have never seen before  The power of the three rings is ended The time has come for the dominion of men   Oh pity He sighs I would have like to have held it one last time   We set out to save the Shire Sam and it has been saved but not for me   You dont mean that You cant leave  So you have come here for information I have some for you Something festers in the heart of Middle Earth Something that you have failed to see But the great eye has seen it Even now he presses his advantage His attack will come soon You are all going to die But you know this dont you Gandalf You cannot think that this Ranger will ever sit upon the throne of Gondor This exile crept from the shadows will never be crowned King Gandalf does not hesitate to sacrifice those who are closest to him those he professes to love Tell me what words of comfort did you give the Halfling before you sent him to his doom The path that you have set him on can only lead to death  Save your pity and your mercy I have no use for it Saruman your staff is broken Grima You need not follow him You were not always as you are now You were once a man of Rohan Come down  Ive heard enough Shoot him Stick an arrow in his gob The last pages are for you Sam  Free He will never be free No  My dear Sam you cannot always be torn in two You will have to be one and whole for many years You have so much to enjoy and to be and to do Your part in the story will go on   Well Im back  I didnt think it would end this way   End No the journey doesnt end here Death is just another path one that we all must take The grey rain curtain of this world rolls back and all turns to silvered glass And then you see it  A man of Rohan What is the house of Rohan but a thatched barn where brigands drink in the reek and their brats roll on the floor with the dogs The victory at Helms Deep does not belong to you Theoden Horse Master You are a lesser son of greater sires Grima Come down Be free of him No Come down Saruman and your life will be spared What Gandalf See what  Rally to me To meeee Feast on his flesh  I will kill you if you touch him  The City has fallen silent There is no warmth left in the sun  It grows so cold  Its just the damp of the first spring rain  No No it isnt   Well thats not so bad   White shores and beyond a far green country under a swift sunrise  I do not believe this darkness will endure   Look The Orcs theyre moving off  Get down cur Ah Saruman You were deep in the enemys counsel Tell us what you know You withdraw your guard and I will tell you where your doom will be decided I will not be held prisoner here Send word to all our allies and to every corner of Middle Earth that still stands free The enemy moves

And you Frodo Baggins I give you the light of Erendil our most beloved star May it be a light for you in dark places when all other lights go out  Im so sorry Sam Im so sorry  NO One that is cursed Long ago the men of the mountains swore an oath to the last King of Gondor to come to his aid to fight But when the time came when Gondors need was dire they fled vanishing into the darkness of the mountain And so Isildur cursed them never to rest until they had fulfilled their pledge Who shall call them from the grey twilight the forgotten people The heir of him to whom the oath they swore From the North shall he come need shall drive him He shall pass the door to the Paths of the Dead  Got away did it precious Not this time Not this time  What kind of army would linger in such a place  The very warmth of my blood seems stolen away  The way is shut It was made by those who are dead and the dead keep it The way is shut  Brego I do not fear death The scouts report Minas Tirith is surrounded The lower levels in flames Everywhere legions of the enemy advance  This task was appointed to you Frodo of the Shire If you do not find a way no one will  Time is against us Make ready Take heart Merry It will soon be over  My lady You are fair and brave and have much to live for and many who love you I know it is too late to turn aside I know there is not much point now in hoping If I were a knight of Rohan capable of great deedsbut Im not Im a Hobbit And I know I cant save Middle Earth I just want to help my friends Frodo Sam Pippin More than anything I wish I could see them again  Make haste We ride through the night  Back to the gate Hurry To battle Well this is a thing unheard of An elf will go underground where a dwarf dare not Oh Oh Id never hear the end of it  Prepare to move out All my friends have gone to battle I would be ashamed to be left behind  It is a threeday gallop to Minas Tirith and none of my riders can bear you as a burdon  I want to fight I will say no more  Ride with me My lady To battle We must ride light and swift It is a long road ahead and man and beast must reach the end with the strength to fight  Ride Ride now to Gondor  What is it What do you see  Little Hobbits do not belong in war Master Meriadoc  Where  I see shapes of men and of horses  Do not look down  Pale banners like shreds of cloud Spears rise like winter thickets through a shroud of mist The dead are following They have been summoned   The dead Summoned I knew that Huh Huh Very good Very good Legolas  Who enters my domain  One who will have your allegiance  You will suffer me The dead do not suffer the living to pass  The way is shut It was made by those who are dead And the dead keep it The Ghostly army closes around them The way is shut Now you must

half of what I had hoped for  You have my word Fight and I will release you from this living death What say you  Fear The city is rank with it Ha ha ha ha Let us ease their pain Release the prisoners The horses are restless and the men are quiet  They grow nervous in the shadow of the mountain  That road there where does that lead   It is the road to the Dimholt the door under the mountain  Catapults ha ha ha  More will come My sons are spent My line has ended  Six thousand will not be enough to break the lines of Mordor  Every hour lost hastens Gondors defeat We have until dawn then we must ride  My line has ended My lord Rohan has deserted us Theodens betrayed me ABANDON YOUR POSTS FLEE FLEE FOR YOUR LIVES  Prepare for battle Hurry men To the wall Defend the wall Over here Return

Lets find some food  There A true esquire of Rohan  Im ready Sorry It isnt all that dangerous Its not even sharp  Hes alive Stay where you are To the smithy go  You should not encourage him  You should not doubt him  Sir King Theoden awaits you my lord  Watch out Down to the lower levels quick I do not doubt his heart only the reach of his arm  Why should Merry be left behind He has as much cause to go to war as you Why can he not fight for those he loves  Double up men Hold them back do not give in to fear Stand to your posts Fight  Not at the towers Aim for the trolls kill the trolls  You know as little of war as that Hobbit When the fear takes him and the blood and the screams and the horror of battle take hold Do you think he would stand and fight He would flee And he would be right to do so War is the province of men Eowyn  Bring them down They called us out to fight  Fight them back Peregrin Took Go back to the Citadel  This is no place for a Hobbit What are you doing you useless scum  My lord Elrond Guard of the Citadel indeed Now back up the hill quickly Quick  The door wont give Its too strong  I come on behalf of one whom I love Arwen is dying She will not long survive the evil that now spreads from Mordor The light of the evenstar is failing As Saurons power grows her strength wanes Arwens life is now tied to the fate of the Ring The Shadow is upon us Aragorn The end has come  There are none  There are those that dwell in the mountain  Murderers traitors You would call upon them to fight They believe in nothing They answer to no one  I take my leave  Sauron will not have forgotten the sword of Elendil   You ride to war but not to victory Saurons armies ride on Minas Tirith this you know But in secret he sends another force which will attack from the river A fleet of Corsair ships sails from the South They will be in the city in two days Youre outnumbered Aragorn You need more men  It will not be our end but his  They will answer to the King of Gondor Andril the Flame of the West forged from the shards of Narsil  The blade that was broken shall return to Minas Tirith  The man who can wield the power of this sword can summon to him an army more deadly than any that walks this earth Put aside the Ranger Become who you were born to be nen iEstel Edain  chebin Estel anim  I didnt think they would find any livery that would fit me  It once belonged to a young boy of the city A very foolish one who wasted many hours slaying dragons instead of attending his studies  This was yours  Yes it was mine My father had it made for me  Get back there and smash it down But nothing can breach it  It was well done A generous deed should not be checked with cold counsel You are to join the tower guard  What were you thinking Peregrin Took What service can a Hobbit offer such a great lord of men  Grond Grond Grond Grond Grond  Grond Grond Grond Grond  Eowyn Why are you doing this The war lies to the East You cannot leave on the eve of battle You cannot abandon the men  Grond will breach it Bring out the wolfs head  We need you here  I have wished you joy since first I saw you  Just where do you think youre off to  Not this time This time you must stay Gimli  Hmmmm Have you learnt nothing of the stubbornness of dwarves  You might as well accept it Were going with you laddie Aragorn smiles  Do you not know  It is but a shadow and a thought that you love I cannot give you what you seek  He leaves because there is no hope  He leaves because he must  Well Im taller than you were then Though Im not likely to grow anymore except sideways  Why have you come  Whats happening where is he going I dont understand Lord Aragorn Why does he leave on the eve of battle  It never fitted me either Boromir was always the soldier They were so alike he and my father Proud stubborn even but strong  I think you have strength of a different kind And one day your father will see it  And I shall not forget it nor fail to reward that which is given Fealty with love Valour with honour Disloyalty with vengeance I do not think we should so lightly abandon the outer defences Defences that your brother long held intact  What would you have me do  I will not yield the River and Pellenor unfought Osgiliath must be retaken  My lord Osgiliath is over run  Much must be risked in war Is there a Captain here who still has the courage to do his lords will  You wish now that our places had been exchanged That I had died and Boromir had lived  Here do I swear fealty and service to Gondor in peace or war in living or dying from from this hour henceforth until my lord release me or death take me   No we cannot But we will meet them in battle nonetheless  I have left instruction The people are to follow your rule in my stead Take up my seat in the Golden Hall Long may you defend Edoras if the battle goes ill  What other duty would you have me do my lord  Duty no I would have you smile again not grieve for those whose time has come You shall live to see these days renewed and no more despair  Yes I wish that  Since you are robbed of Boromir I will do what I can in his stead If I should return think better of me father  To few

Hes poisoned you against me  You cant help me any more  You dont mean that  Go home  Can you sing Master Hobbit   well yes At least well enough for my own people But we have no songs for great halls and evil times  Saurons wrath will be terrible his retribution swift  The battle for Helms Deep is over The battle for Middleearth is about to begin  looking back out to Mordor All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits  In Ithilien Not two days ago Gandalf theyre taking the road to the Morgul vale  Where does my allegiance lie if not here This is the city of the men of Nmenor I will gladly give my life to defend her beauty her memory her wisdom  What does that mean Whats wrong He looks at Gandalf   Faramir Faramir Your fathers will has turned to madness Do not throw away your life so rashly  Your father loves you Faramir He will remember it before the end  And then the pass of Cirith Ungol  What you judged to be right You sent the Ring of power into Mordor in the hands of a witless Halfling It should have been brought back to the citadel to be kept safe Hidden Dark and deep in the vaults not to be used unless at the uttermost end of need  I would not use the Ring Not if Minas Tirith were falling in ruin and I alone could save her  Ever you desire to appear lordly and gracious as a King of old Boromir would have remembered his fathers need He would have brought me a kingly gift Boromir would not have brought the Ring He would have stretched out his hand to this thing and taking it he would have fallen  This is how you would serve your city You would risk its utter ruin  I did what I judged to be right  And why should your songs be unfit for my halls Come sing me a song  Home is behind The world ahead And there are many paths to tread Through shadow to the edge of night Until the stars are all alight Mist and shadow cloud and shade All shall fade All shall fade  Faramir tell me everything Tell me all you know  March march March march march   somewhere in the wilderness  I wonder if well ever be put into songs or tales  What  I wonder if people will ever say Lets hear about Frodo and the Ring And theyll say Yes Thats one of my favourite stories Frodo was really courageous wasnt he Dad Yes my boy The most famousest of Hobbits And thats saying a lot  Well youve left out one of the chief characters Samwise the Brave I want to hear more about Sam  Frodo wouldnt have got far without Sam  Smeagol  So was l  Master Master looks after us Master wouldnt hurt us  Now Mr Frodo you shouldnt make fun I was being serious  Dont ask Smeagol Poor poor Smeagol  Samwise the Brave  Master broke his promise  You know nothing of this matter Were not going to wait for you Come on  Father  My son Leave me  Careful master Careful Very far to fall Very dangerous are the stairs  Come master  Come to Smeagol  Mr Frodo Get back you Dont touch him  Master betrayed us Wicked Tricksy False We ought to wring his filthy little neck Kill him Kill him Kill them both And then we take the precious and we be the master  He would have kept it for his own And when he returned you would not have known your son  Send forth all legions Do not stop the attack until the city is taken  Boromir was loyal to me Not some wizards pupil  Why does he hates poor Smeagol What has Smeagol ever done to him Master Master carries a heavy burden Smeagol knows heavy heavy burden Fat one cannot know He wants it He needs it Smeagol sees it in his eye Very soon he will ask you for it You will see The fat one will take it from you  But the fat Hobbit he knows Eyes always watching  Yes No No Its too risky Its too risky  Where is he Where has he gone Hey Gollum Where are you  Smeagol  We could let do it  Yes She could do it  Yes precious she could And then we takes it once theyre dead  Yes Yes Yes  Kill them both  Come on Hobbits Long ways to go yet Smeagol will show you the way  Then we stabs them out Put out his eyeses and make him crawl  Once theyre dead

embedded in his nervous system  He doesnt look too happy does he  Not too happy at all Merry  Still I suppose the view would be quite nice from up there  He was already dead  What of the wizard  No it

mountains  Cirith Ungol  ls that its name  No No Yes  This is the old sewer Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city Youll find cover in the woods there  Captain Faramir you have shown your quality sir  The very highest  I must  lt is the only way Master says we must go to Mordor so we must try  Thank you   Go Frodo Go with the goodwill of all Men  Frodo they say a dark terror dwells in the passes above Minas Morgul You cannot go that way  May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm  Come on keep up  Mr Frodo didnt mean for them Rangers to hurt you You know that

no no hard feelings Gollum Gollum Yes master Nice Hobbits  So theres no hard feelings Forgive and forget  Save me  Do you want to know what happened to Boromir You want to know why your brother died He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him He tried to kill him The Ring drove your brother mad  Watch out Mr Frodo  Theyre here  Nazgul Theyve come  The fortress is taken It is over  You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it They still defend it They have died defending it  Theyre past the door They are breaking in Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves  Stay here Keep out of sight Take cover  Is there no other way  Nan Barad Nan Barad Haldir nan Barad  What are you doing What are you stopping for  Nan Barad To the Keep Haldir So much death What can Men do against such reckless hate  Ride out with me Ride out and meet them  Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass And barricade the entrance For Rohan For your people  Aragorn Fall back to the Keep Get your men out of there  There is one passage It leads into the mountains But they will not get far The Urukhai are too many  The sun is rising  Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day At dawn Iook to the east  Yes  Yes Yes The horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the Deep one last time  For death and glory  Gandalf   Theoden King stands alone  Brace the gate Hold them To the gate Draw your swords Make way We cannot hold much longer  Hold them How long do you need  Fell deeds awake Now for wrath now for ruin and a red dawn  As long as you can give me  Let this be the hour when we draw swords together  Forth Eorlingas  Gimli Timbers Brace the gate Come on We can take them  Toss me  To the king Yes A hit A fine

Aragorn Follow me to the barricade  Make way Fall back Fall back I cant do this Sam  I know Its all wrong By rights we shouldnt even be here But we are Its like in the great stories Mr Frodo The ones that really mattered Full of darkness and danger they were And sometimes you didnt want to know the end because how could the end be happy How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened  Victory We have victory Not a word  What are we holding on to Sam  That theres some good in this world Mr Frodo And its worth fighting for  I think at last we understand one another Frodo Baggins  You know the laws of our country the laws of your father If you let them go your life will be forfeit  Then it is forfeit Release them  They have broken through The castle is breached Retreat Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back only they didnt They kept going because they were holding on to something  But in the end its only a passing thing this shadow Even darkness must pass A new day will come And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer Those were the stories that stayed with you that meant something Even if you were too small to understand why But I think Mr Frodo I do understand I know now  Retreat Hurry Inside Get them inside Into the Keep Pull everybody back Pull them back  Fall back I will leave you at the western borders of the forest You can make your way north to your homeland from there  That doesnt make sense to me But then you are very small Perhaps youre right South it is then Hold on little Shirelings I always like going south Somehow it feels like going downhill  Are you mad Well be caught  No we wont Not this time  Look Osgiliath burns Mordor has come  The Ring will not save Gondor It has only the power to destroy Please Iet me go  South But that will lead you past lsengard  Yes Exactly If we go south we can slip past Saruman unnoticed The closer we are to danger the farther we are from harm Its the last thing hell expect  Wait Stop Stop Turn around Turn around Take us south  Hurry  Faramir You must let me go And those little family of field mice that climb up sometimes and they tickle me awfully  They had voices of their own  Saruman A wizard should know better There is no curse in Elvish Entish or the tongues of Men for this treachery  You could have picked a better spot  Well lad whatever

Wheres my firstborn  Father Leaves more time for drinking Break out the ale These men are thirsty Good speech Nice and short  They exaggerate The victory belongs to Faramir also  Were you not entrusted to protect it  But for Faramir this city would still be standing  Oh too few You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim Always you cast a poor reflection on me  I would have done but our numbers were too few  That is not my intent  For Gondor They say you vanquished the enemy almost singlehandedly  You give him no credit and yet he tries to do your will  lt has fallen into the hands of the Elves Everyone will try to claim it Men Dwarves wizards We cannot let that happen This thing must come to Gondor  Gondor   Its dangerous I know Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser Men But you you are strong And our need is great It is our blood which is being spilled our people who are dying Sauron is biding his time Hes massing fresh armies He will return And when he does we will be powerless to stop him You must go Bring me back this mighty gift  No My place is here with my people Not in Rivendell  Would you deny your own father  He loves you Father  lf

strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall  Dead How When  As one of his companions Id hoped you would tell me  If something has happened to Boromir we would have you tell us  His horn washed up upon the riverbank about six days past It was cloven in two But more than this I know it in my heart He was my brother  This is no rabble of mindless Orcs These are Urukhai Their armour is thick and their shields broad  I have fought many wars Master Dwarf I know how to defend my own keep  Let them come They do not come to destroy Rohans crops or villages They come to destroy its people down to the last child  We will cover the causeway and the gate from above No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall or set foot inside the Hornburg It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead  They will break upon this fortress like water on rock Sarumans hordes will pillage and burn Weve seen it before Crops can be resown homes rebuilt Within these walls we will outlast them  What would you have me do Look at my men Their courage hangs by a thread If this is to be our end then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance  And who will come Elves Dwarves We are not so lucky in our friends as you The old alliances are dead  Gondor will answer  We need more time to lay provisions The light of the Evenstardoes not wax and wane It is mine to give

the wind We even forgot our own name  Gollum Gollum Gollum and we wept precious We wept to be so alone  Not before Mr Frodos had something to eat  No time to lose silly Come on Must go No time And Ive gone and had too much It must be getting late  No it isnt It isnt midday yet The days are growing darker  Here  What about you  Oh no Im not hungry leastways not for lembas bread  Sam Aragorn Now come

maruvan ar Hildinyar tenn Ambarmetta Hannon le   My friends you bow to noone   And thus it was a Fourth Age of Middle Earth began And the Fellowship of the Ring though eternally bound by friendship and love was ended Thirteen months to the day since Gandalf sent us on our long journey we find ourselves looking upon a familiar sight  Alright We were home  Hey watch the pumpkin  The journey home  Oh alright but we dont have that much left We have to be careful or we are going to run out You go ahead and eat that Mr Frodo Ive rationed it there should be enough  Come Hobbitses very close now Very close to Mordor No safe places here Hurry  Its good Definitely from the Shire Longbottom leaf eh  uhh huh I feel like Im back at the Green Dragon  Mmmm Green Dragon  For what  Goodnight lads  Welcome my lords to Isengard  You young rascals A merry hunt youve led us on and now we find you feasting and and smoking Hmm  Only youve never done a hard days work  Ahaha  How do you pick up the threads of an old life How do you go on when in your heart you begin to understand there is no going back There are some things that time cannot mend Some hurts that go too deep that have taken hold  Mr Frodo What is it  Its been four years to the day since Weathertop Sam Its never really healed  A mug of ale in my hand Putting my feet up on a settle after a hard days work   There and Back Again a Hobbits tale by Bilbo Baggins and the Lord of the Rings by Frodo Baggins You finished it  Not quite Theres room for a little more   Bilbo once told me his part in this tale would end That each of us must come and go in the telling Bilbos story was now over There would be no more journeys for him save one  To the harbour Bilbo The elves have accorded you a special honour A place on the last ship to leave Middle Earth  Salted pork Hobbits Were under orders from Treebeard whos taken over management of Isengard   Tell me again lad where are we going   Frodo any chance of seeing that old Ring of mine again The one I gave you  Hoooom young master Gandalf Im glad youve come Wood and water stock and stone I can master but there is a Wizard to manage here locked in his tower   We are sitting on a field of victory enjoying a few well earned comforts The salted pork is particularly good   Show yourself  Well then lets just have his head and be done with it  Be careful Even in defeat Saruman is dangerous  You have fought many wars and slain many men Theoden King and made peace afterwards Can we not take counsel together as we once did my old friend Can we not have peace you and I  We shall have peace We shall have peace when you answer for the burning of the Westfold and the children that lie dead there We shall have peace when the lives of the soldiers whose bodies were hewn even as they lay dead against the gates of the Hornburg are avenged When you hang from a gibbet for the sport of your own crows we shall have peace Gibbets and crows Dotard What do you want Gandalf Grahame Let me guess the key of Orthanc Or perhaps the keys of Barad Dr itself Along with the crowns of the seven Kings and the rods of the Five Wizards No we need him alive We need him to talk  Im sorry uncle Im afraid I lost it  Your treachery has already cost many lives Thousands more are now at risk But you could save them Saruman You were deep in the enemys counsel  I Aear cn ven na mar  I think Im quite ready for another adventure   Farewell my brave Hobbits My work is now finished Here at last on the shores of the sea comes the end of our Fellowship I will not say do not weep for not all tears are an evil It is time Frodo  What does he mean  Oh Well here is a sight I have never seen before  The power of the three rings is ended The time has come for the dominion of men   Oh pity He sighs I would have like to have held it one last time   We set out to save the Shire Sam and it has been saved but not for me   You dont mean that You cant leave  So you have come here for information I have some for you Something festers in the heart of Middle Earth Something that you have failed to see But the great eye has seen it Even now he presses his advantage His attack will come soon You are all going to die But you know this dont you Gandalf You cannot think that this Ranger will ever sit upon the throne of Gondor This exile crept from the shadows will never be crowned King Gandalf does not hesitate to sacrifice those who are closest to him those he professes to love Tell me what words of comfort did you give the Halfling before you sent him to his doom The path that you have set him on can only lead to death  Save your pity and your mercy I have no use for it Saruman your staff is broken Grima You need not follow him You were not always as you are now You were once a man of Rohan Come down  Ive heard enough Shoot him Stick an arrow in his gob The last pages are for you Sam  Free He will never be free No  My dear Sam you cannot always be torn in two You will have to be one and whole for many years You have so much to enjoy and to be and to do Your part in the story will go on   Well Im back  I didnt think it would end this way   End No the journey doesnt end here Death is just another path one that we all must take The grey rain curtain of this world rolls back and all turns to silvered glass And then you see it  A man of Rohan What is the house of Rohan but a thatched barn where brigands drink in the reek and their brats roll on the floor with the dogs The victory at Helms Deep does not belong to you Theoden Horse Master You are a lesser son of greater sires Grima Come down Be free of him No Come down Saruman and your life will be spared What Gandalf See what  Rally to me To meeee Feast on his flesh  I will kill you if you touch him  The City has fallen silent There is no warmth left in the sun  It grows so cold  Its just the damp of the first spring rain  No No it isnt   Well thats not so bad   White shores and beyond a far green country

And you Frodo Baggins I give you the light of Erendil our most beloved star May it be a light for you in dark places when all other lights go out  Im so sorry Sam Im so sorry  NO One that is cursed Long ago the men of the mountains swore an oath to the last King of Gondor to come to his aid to fight But when the time came when Gondors need was dire they fled vanishing into the darkness of the mountain And so Isildur cursed them never to rest until they had fulfilled their pledge Who shall call them from the grey twilight the forgotten people The heir of him to whom the oath they swore From the North shall he come need shall drive him He shall pass the door to the Paths of the Dead  Got away did it precious Not this time Not this time  What kind of army would linger in such a place  The very warmth of my blood seems stolen away  The way is shut It was made by those who are dead and the dead keep it The way is shut  Brego I do not fear death The scouts report Minas Tirith is surrounded The lower levels in flames Everywhere legions of the enemy advance  This task was appointed to you Frodo of the Shire If you do not find a way no one will  Time is against us Make ready Take heart Merry It will soon be over  My lady You are fair and brave and have much to live for and many who love you I know it is too late to turn aside I know there is not much point now in hoping If I were a knight of Rohan capable of great deedsbut Im not Im a Hobbit And I know I cant save Middle Earth I just want to help my friends Frodo Sam Pippin More than anything I wish I could see them again  Make haste We ride through the night  Back to the gate Hurry To battle Well this is a thing unheard of An elf will go underground where a dwarf dare not Oh Oh Id never hear the end of it  Prepare to move out All my friends have gone to battle I would be ashamed to be left behind  It is a threeday gallop to Minas Tirith and none of my riders can bear you as a burdon  I want to fight I will say no more  Ride with me My lady To battle We must ride light and swift It is a long road ahead and man and beast must reach the end with the strength to fight  Ride Ride now to Gondor  What is it What do you see  Little Hobbits do not belong in war Master Meriadoc  Where  I see shapes of men and of horses  Do not look down  Pale banners like shreds of cloud Spears rise like winter thickets through a shroud of mist The dead are following They have been summoned   The dead Summoned I knew that Huh Huh Very good Very good Legolas  Who enters my domain  One who will have your allegiance  You will suffer me The dead do not suffer the living to pass  The way is shut It was made by those who are dead And the dead keep it The Ghostly army closes around them The way is shut Now you must die Form up move out Form up move out  My lord Hail to you sire I bring 500 men from the Westfold my lord  We have 300 more from Fenmarch Theoden King  That blade was broken It has been remade Fight

King Make way the King is here  I summon you to fulfil your oath Ach You waste your time Aragorn They had no honour in life and they have none now in death  Legolas Run We fight Open the gate quick  Quick Hurry Faramir Say not that he has fallen  They were outnumbered None survived  Stand you traitors Out Where are the riders from Snowbourn  None have come my lord  Six thousand spears less than half of what I had hoped for  You have my word Fight and I will release you from this living death What say you  Fear The city is rank with it Ha ha ha ha Let us ease their pain Release the prisoners The horses are restless and the men are quiet  They grow nervous in the shadow of the mountain  That road there where does that lead   It is the road to the Dimholt the door under the mountain  Catapults ha ha ha  More will come My sons are spent My line has ended  Six thousand will not be enough to break the lines of Mordor  Every hour lost hastens Gondors defeat We have until dawn then we must ride  My line has ended My lord Rohan has deserted us Theodens betrayed me ABANDON YOUR POSTS FLEE FLEE FOR YOUR LIVES  Prepare for battle Hurry men To the wall Defend the wall Over here Return to your posts  Send these foul beasts into the Abyss  The house of Stewards has failed  We need more rubble He needs medicine my lord None who venture there ever return That mountain is evil  Aragorn Lets find some food  There A true esquire of Rohan  Im ready Sorry It isnt all that dangerous Its not even sharp  Hes alive Stay where you are To the smithy go  You should not encourage him  You should not doubt him  Sir King Theoden awaits you my lord  Watch out Down to the lower levels quick I do not doubt his heart only the reach of his arm  Why should Merry be left behind He has as much cause to go to war as you Why can he not fight for those he loves  Double up men Hold them back do not give in to fear Stand to your posts Fight  Not at the towers Aim for the trolls kill the trolls  You know as little of war as that Hobbit When the fear takes him and the blood and the screams and the horror of battle take hold Do you think he would stand and fight He would flee And he would be right to do so War is the province of men Eowyn  Bring them down They called us out to fight  Fight them back Peregrin Took Go back to the Citadel  This is no place for a Hobbit What are you doing you useless scum  My lord Elrond Guard of the Citadel indeed Now back up the hill quickly Quick  The door wont give Its too strong  I come on behalf of one whom I love Arwen is dying She will not long survive the evil that now spreads from Mordor The light of the evenstar is failing As Saurons power grows her strength wanes Arwens life is now tied to the fate of the Ring The Shadow is upon us Aragorn The end has come  There are none  There are those that dwell in the mountain  Murderers traitors You would call upon them to fight They believe in nothing They answer to no one  I take my leave  Sauron will not have forgotten the sword of Elendil   You ride to war but not to victory Saurons armies ride on Minas Tirith this you know But in secret he sends another force which will attack from the river A fleet of Corsair ships sails from the South They will be in the city in two days Youre outnumbered Aragorn You need more men  It will not be our end but his  They will answer to the King of Gondor Andril the Flame of the West forged from the shards of Narsil  The blade that was broken shall return to Minas Tirith  The man who can wield the power of this sword can summon to him an army more deadly than any that walks this earth Put aside the Ranger Become who you were born to be nen iEstel Edain  chebin Estel anim  I didnt think they would find any livery that would fit me  It once belonged to a young boy of the city A very foolish one who wasted many hours slaying dragons instead of attending his studies  This was yours  Yes it was mine My father had it made for me  Get back there and smash it down But nothing can breach it  It was well done A generous deed should not be checked with cold counsel You are to join the tower guard  What were you thinking Peregrin Took What service can a Hobbit offer such a great lord of men  Grond Grond Grond Grond Grond  Grond Grond Grond Grond  Eowyn Why are you doing this The war lies to the East You cannot leave on the eve of battle You cannot abandon the men  Grond will breach it Bring out the wolfs head  We need you here  I have wished you joy since first I saw you  Just where do you think youre off to  Not this time This time you must stay Gimli  Hmmmm Have you learnt nothing of the stubbornness of dwarves  You might as well accept it Were going with you laddie Aragorn smiles  Do you not know  It is but a shadow and a thought that you love I cannot give you what you seek  He leaves because there is no hope  He leaves because he must  Well Im taller than you were then Though Im not likely to grow anymore except sideways  Why have you come  Whats happening where is he going I dont understand Lord Aragorn Why does he leave on the eve of battle  It never fitted me either Boromir was always the soldier They were so alike he and my father Proud stubborn even but strong  I think you have strength of a different kind And one day your father will see it  And I shall not forget it nor fail to reward that which is given Fealty with love Valour with honour Disloyalty with vengeance I do not think we should so lightly abandon the outer defences Defences that your brother long held intact  What would you have me do  I will not yield the River and Pellenor unfought Osgiliath must be retaken  My lord Osgiliath is over run  Much must be risked in war Is there a Captain here who still has the courage to do his lords will  You wish now that our places had been exchanged That I had died and Boromir had lived  Here do I swear fealty and service to Gondor in peace or war in living or dying from from this hour henceforth until my lord release me or death take me   No we cannot But we will meet them in battle nonetheless  I have left instruction The people are to follow your rule in my stead Take up my seat in the Golden Hall Long may you defend Edoras if the battle goes ill  What other duty would you have me do my lord  Duty no I would have you smile again not grieve for those whose time has come You shall live to see these days renewed and no more despair  Yes I wish that  Since you are robbed of Boromir I will do what I can in his stead If I should return think better of me father  To few have come We cannot defeat the armies of Mordor  Sneaking Sneaking Fat Hobbit is always so polite Smeagol shows them secret ways that nobody else could find and they say sneak Sneak Very nice friend

manner of your return  He took it He must have  Smeagol No no not poor Smeagol Smeagol hates nasty elf bread  Youre a lying rat What did you do with it   He doesnt eat it He cant have taken it   Look

a bit  Keep going Its the Nazgul Take cover my lord Its coming  Sam Its Mithrandir The White Rider Foreseen and done nothing Faramir This is not the first Halfling to have crossed your path  Pull Mithrandir They broke through our defences Theyve taken the bridge and the West bank Battalions of Orcs are crossing the river  It is as the Lord Denethor predicted Long has he foreseen this doom Youve seen Frodo and Sam  No  Where When  I dont want to keep it I just want to help  See See He wants it for himself  Shut up you Go away Get out of here  No Sam Its you Im sorry Sam  But hes a liar Hes poisoned you against me  You cant help me any more  You dont mean that  Go home  Can you sing Master Hobbit   well yes At least well enough for my own people But we have no songs for great halls and evil times  Saurons wrath will be terrible his retribution swift  The battle for Helms Deep is over The battle for Middleearth is about to begin  looking back out to Mordor All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits  In Ithilien Not two days ago Gandalf theyre taking the road to the Morgul vale  Where does my allegiance lie if not here This is the city of the men of Nmenor I will gladly give my life to defend her beauty her memory her wisdom  What does that mean Whats wrong He looks at Gandalf   Faramir Faramir Your fathers will has turned to madness Do not throw away your life so rashly  Your father loves you Faramir He will remember it before the end  And then the pass of Cirith Ungol  What you judged to be right You sent the Ring of power into Mordor in the hands of a witless Halfling It should have been brought back to the citadel to be kept safe Hidden Dark and deep in the vaults not to be used unless at the uttermost end of need  I would not use the Ring Not if Minas Tirith were falling in ruin and I alone could save her  Ever you desire to appear lordly and gracious as a King of old Boromir would have remembered his fathers need He would have brought me a kingly gift Boromir would not have brought the Ring He would have stretched out his hand to this thing and taking it he would have fallen  This is how you would serve your city You would risk its utter ruin  I did what I judged to be right  And why should your songs be unfit for my halls Come sing me a song  Home is behind The world ahead And there are many paths to tread Through shadow to the edge of night Until the stars are all alight Mist and shadow cloud and shade All shall fade All shall fade  Faramir tell me everything Tell me all you know  March march March march march   somewhere in the wilderness  I wonder if well ever be put into songs or tales  What  I wonder if people will ever say Lets hear about Frodo and the Ring And theyll say Yes Thats one of my favourite stories Frodo was really courageous wasnt he Dad Yes my boy The most famousest of Hobbits And thats saying a lot  Well youve left out one of the chief characters Samwise the Brave I want to hear more about Sam  Frodo wouldnt have got far without Sam  Smeagol  So was l  Master Master looks after us Master wouldnt hurt us  Now Mr Frodo you shouldnt make fun I was being serious  Dont ask Smeagol Poor poor Smeagol  Samwise the Brave  Master broke his promise  You know nothing of this matter Were not going to wait for you Come on  Father  My son Leave me  Careful master Careful Very far to fall Very dangerous are the stairs  Come master  Come to Smeagol  Mr Frodo Get back you Dont touch him  Master betrayed us Wicked Tricksy False We ought to wring his filthy little neck Kill him Kill him Kill them both And then we take the precious and we be the master  He would have kept it for his own And when he returned you would not have known your son  Send forth all legions Do not stop the attack until the city is taken  Boromir was loyal to me Not some wizards pupil  Why does he hates poor Smeagol What has Smeagol ever done to him Master Master carries a heavy burden Smeagol knows heavy heavy burden Fat one cannot know He wants it He needs it Smeagol sees it in his eye Very soon he will ask you for it You will see The fat one will take it from you  But the fat Hobbit he knows Eyes always watching  Yes No No Its too risky Its too risky  Where is he Where has he gone Hey Gollum Where are you  Smeagol  We could let do it  Yes She could do it  Yes precious she could And then we takes it once theyre dead  Yes Yes Yes  Kill them both  Come on Hobbits Long ways to go yet Smeagol will show you the way  Then we stabs them out Put out his eyeses and make him crawl  Once theyre dead Ssssssssssssssh  Stay out of the forest Keep away from the trees Final count 42  Fortytwo Thats not bad for a pointyeared Elvish princeling I myself am sitting pretty on 43  Fortythree  I will break him  Where are Theodens riders  Will Rohans army come Mithrandir  Courage is the best defence that you have now  Follow me  He was twitching  Slay them all He was twitching because hes got my axe embedded in his nervous system  He doesnt look too happy does he  Not too happy at all Merry  Still I suppose the view would be quite nice from up there  He was already dead  What of the wizard  No it isnt Im starving  Good luck trying to find something decent around here Probably only dead rats and mouldy bread  Sarumans storeroom I dont believe it  It cant be  lt is Oh yes Its a quality establishment I hear the staff are very good  What are you doing  Nothing The worlds back to normal thats all  Its perfect One barrel each Wait Do you think we should share it with Treebeard  Share it No No Dead plant and all that Dont think hed understand Could be a distant relative  I get it Dont be hasty   Exactly Barhrum  Longbottom Leaf The finest pipeweed in South Farthing  The Shire must truly be a great realm Master Gamgee where gardeners are held in high honor  What road will you take once you reach the woods  Gollum says theres a path near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains  Cirith Ungol  ls that its name  No No Yes  This is the old sewer Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city Youll find cover in the woods there  Captain Faramir you have shown your quality sir  The very highest  I must  lt is the only way Master says we must go to Mordor so we must try  Thank you   Go Frodo Go with the goodwill of all Men  Frodo they say a dark terror dwells in the passes above Minas Morgul You cannot go that way  May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm  Come on keep up  Mr Frodo didnt mean for them Rangers to hurt you You know that

Its calling to him Sam His Eye is almost on me  Hold on Mr Frodo Youll be all right  Take them to my father Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war  No no no hard feelings Gollum Gollum Yes master Nice Hobbits  So theres no hard feelings Forgive and forget  Save me  Do you want to know what happened to Boromir You want to know why your brother died He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him He tried to kill him The Ring drove your brother mad  Watch out Mr Frodo  Theyre here  Nazgul Theyve come  The fortress is taken It is over  You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it They still defend it They have died defending it  Theyre past the door They are breaking in Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves  Stay here Keep out of sight Take cover  Is there no other way  Nan Barad Nan Barad Haldir nan Barad  What are you doing What are you stopping for  Nan Barad To the Keep Haldir So much death What can Men do against such reckless hate  Ride out with me Ride out and meet them  Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass And barricade the entrance For Rohan For your people  Aragorn Fall back to the Keep Get your men out of there  There is one passage It leads into the mountains But they will not get far The Urukhai are too many  The sun is rising  Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day At dawn Iook to the east  Yes  Yes Yes The horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the Deep one last time  For death and glory  Gandalf   Theoden King stands alone  Brace the gate Hold them To the gate Draw your swords Make way We cannot hold much longer  Hold them How long do you need  Fell deeds awake Now for wrath now for ruin and a

bad had happened  Victory We have victory Not a word  What are we holding on to Sam  That theres some good in this world Mr Frodo And its worth fighting for  I think at last we understand one another Frodo Baggins  You know the laws of our country the laws of your father If you let them go your life will be forfeit  Then it is forfeit Release them  They have broken through The castle is breached Retreat Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back only they didnt They kept going because they were holding on to something  But in the end its only a passing thing this shadow Even darkness must pass A new day will come And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer Those were the stories that stayed with you that meant something Even if you were too small to understand why But I think Mr Frodo I do understand I know now  Retreat Hurry Inside Get them inside Into the Keep Pull everybody back Pull them back  Fall back I will leave you at the western borders of the forest You can make your way north to your homeland from there  That doesnt make sense to me But then you are very small Perhaps youre right South it is then Hold on little Shirelings I always like going south Somehow it feels like going downhill  Are you mad Well be caught  No we wont Not this time  Look Osgiliath burns Mordor has come  The Ring will not save Gondor It has only the power to destroy Please Iet me go  South But that will lead you past lsengard  Yes Exactly If we go south we can slip past Saruman unnoticed The closer we are to danger the farther we are from harm Its the last thing hell expect  Wait Stop Stop Turn around Turn around Take us south  Hurry  Faramir You must let me go And those little family of field mice that climb up sometimes and they tickle me awfully  They had voices of their own  Saruman A wizard should know better There is no curse in Elvish Entish or the tongues of Men for this treachery  You could have picked a better spot  Well lad whatever

Weve got the Shire Maybe we should go home  The fires of lsengard will spread and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn And And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone There wont be a Shire Pippin  Boromir Boromir This city was once the jewel of our kingdom A place of light and beauty and music And so it shall be once more Let the armies of Mordor know this Never

Wheres my firstborn  Father Leaves more time for drinking Break out the ale These men are thirsty Good speech Nice and short  They exaggerate The victory belongs to Faramir also  Were you not entrusted to protect it  But for Faramir this city would still be standing  Oh too few You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim Always you cast a poor reflection on me  I would have done but our numbers were too few  That is not my intent  For Gondor They say you vanquished the enemy almost singlehandedly  You give him no credit and yet he tries to do your will  lt has fallen into the hands of the Elves Everyone will try to claim it Men Dwarves wizards We cannot let that happen This thing must come to Gondor  Gondor   Its dangerous I know Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser Men But you you are strong And our need is great It is our blood which is being spilled our people who are dying Sauron is biding his time Hes massing fresh armies He will return And when he does we will be powerless to stop him You must go Bring me back this mighty gift  No My place is here with my people Not in Rivendell  Would you deny your own father  He loves you Father  lf

His horn washed up upon the riverbank about six days past It was cloven in two But more than this I know it in my heart He was my brother  This is no rabble of mindless Orcs These are Urukhai Their armour is thick and their shields broad  I have fought many wars Master Dwarf I know how to defend my own keep  Let them come They do not come to destroy Rohans crops or villages They come to destroy its people down to the last child  We will cover the causeway and the gate from above No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall or set foot inside the Hornburg It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead  They will break upon this fortress like water on rock Sarumans hordes will pillage and burn Weve seen it before Crops can be resown homes rebuilt Within these walls we will outlast them  What would you have me do Look at my men Their courage hangs by a thread If this is to be our end then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance  And who will come Elves Dwarves We are not so lucky in our friends as you The old alliances are dead  Gondor will answer  We need more time to lay provisions The light of the Evenstardoes not wax and wane It is mine to give
