              "'classes Slow down Listen to the words in your heart as well as in your mind Savor each story Let it touch you Ask yourself what does it awaken in me What does it suggest for my life What feeling or action does it call forth from my inner being Let yourself have a personal relationship with each story Some stories will speak louder to you than others Some will have deeper meaning

all essence with very little froth In our seminars and workshops we take more time to set up and discuss the implications of each story There are more explanations and explorations of how to apply the lessons and principles to your everyday life Dont just read these stories Take the time to digest them and make them your own  If you find yourself moved to share a story with others do it When a story makes you think of another person call the person it brings to mind and share it Engage these stories and let them move you to do whatever comes up for you They are meant to inspire and motivate you For a lot of these stories we went back to the original source and asked them to write it or tell it in their own words Many of the stories will be in their voice not ours We have attributed every

asked to write an evaluation of each boys future In every case the students wrote He hasnt got a chance Twentyfive years later another sociology professor came across the earlier study He had his students follow up on the project to see what had happened to these boys With the exception of 20 boys who had moved away or died the students learned that 176 of the remaining 180 had achieved more than ordinary success as lawyers doctors and businessmen The professor was astounded and decided to pursue the matter further Fortunately all the men were in the area and he was able to ask each one How do you account for your success In each case the reply came with feeling There was a teacher The teacher was still alive so he sought her out and asked the old but still alert lady what magic formula she had used to pull these boys out of the slums into successful achievement The teachers eyes sparkled and her lips broke into a gentle smile Its really very simple she said I loved those boys Eric Butterworth  All I Remember When my father spoke to me he always began the conversation with Have I told you yet today how much I adore you The expression of love was reciprocated and in his later years as his life began to visibly ebb we grew even closer if that were possible At 82 he was ready to die and I was ready to let him go so that his suffering would end We laughed and cried and held hands and told each other of our love and agreed that it was time I said Dad after youve gone I want a sign from you that youre fine He laughed at the absurdity of that Dad didnt believe in reincarnation I wasnt positive I did either but I had had many experiences that convinced me I could get some signal from the other side My father and I were so deeply connected I felt his heart attack in my chest at the moment he died Later I mourned that the hospital in their sterile wisdom had not let me hold his hand as he had slipped away Day after day I prayed to hear from him but nothing happened Night after night I asked for a dream before I fell asleep And yet four long months passed and I heard and felt nothing but grief at his loss Mother had died five years before of Alzheimers and though I had grown daughters of my own I felt like a lost child One day while I was lying on a massage table in a dark quiet room waiting for my appointment a wave of longing for my father swept over me I began to wonder if I had been too demanding in asking for a sign from him I noticed that my mind was in a hyperacute state I experienced an unfamiliar clarity in which I could have added long columns of figures in my head I checked to make sure I was awake and not dreaming and I saw that I was as far removed from a dreamy state as one could possibly be Each thought I had was like a drop of water disturbing a still pond and I marveled at the peacefulness of each passing moment Then I thought Ive been trying to control the messages from the other side I will stop that now Suddenly my mothers face appearedmy mother as she had been before Alzheimers disease had stripped her of her mind her humanity and 50 pounds Her magnificent silver hair crowned her sweet face She was so real and so close I felt I could reach out and touch her She looked as she had a dozen years ago before the wasting away had begun I even smelled the fragrance of Joy her favorite perfume She  seemed to be waiting and did not speak I wondered how it could happen that I was thinking of my father and my mother appeared and I felt a little guilty that I had not asked for her as well I said Oh Mother Im so sorry that you had to suffer with that horrible disease She tipped her head slightly to one side as though to acknowledge what I had said about her suffering Then she smileda beautiful smileand said very distinctly But all I remember is love And she disappeared I began to shiver in a room suddenly gone cold and I knew in my bones that the love we give and receive is all that matters and all that is remembered Suffering disappears love remains Her words are the most important I have ever heard and that moment is forever engraved on my heart I have not yet seen or heard from my father but I have no doubts that someday when I least expect it he will appear and say Have I told you yet today that I love you Bobbie Probstein  Heart Song Once upon a time there was a great man who married the woman of his dreams With their love they created a little girl She was a bright and cheerful little girl and the great man loved her very much When she was very little he would pick her up hum a tune and dance with her around the room and he would tell her I love you little girl When the little girl was growing up the great man would hug her and tell her I love you little girl The little girl would pout and say Im not a little girl anymore Then the man would laugh and say But to me youll always be my little girl The little girl whowasnotlittleanymore left her home and went into the world As she learned more about herself she learned more about the man She saw that he truly was great and strong for now she recognized his strengths One of his strengths was his ability to express his love to his family It didnt matter where she went in the world the man would call her and say I love you little girl The day came when the little girl whowasnotlittleanymore received a phone call The great man was damaged He had had a stroke He was aphasic they explained to the girl He couldnt talk anymore and they werent sure that he could understand the words spoken to him He could no longer smile laugh walk hug dance or tell the little girl whowasnotlittleanymore that he loved her And so she went to the side of the great man When she walked into the room and saw him he looked small and not strong at all He looked at her and tried to speak but he could not The little girl did the only thing she could do She climbed up on the bed next to the great man Tears ran from both of their eyes and she drew her arms around the useless shoulders of her father Her head on his chest she thought of many things She remembered the wonderful times together and how she had always felt protected and cherished by the great man She felt grief for the loss she was to endure the words of love that had comforted her And then she heard from within the man the beat of his heart The heart where the music and the words had always lived The heart beat on steadily unconcerned about the damage to the rest of the body And while she rested there the magic happened She heard what she needed to hear  His heart beat out the words that his mouth could no longer say I love you I love you I love you Little girl Little girl Little girl And she was comforted Patty Hansen  True Love Moses Mendelssohn the grandfather of the wellknown German composer was far from being handsome Along with a rather short stature he had a grotesque hunchback One day he visited a merchant in Hamburg who had a lovely daughter named Frumtje Moses fell hopelessly in love with her But Frumtje was repulsed by his misshapen appearance When it came time for him to leave Moses gathered his courage and climbed the stairs to her room to take one last opportunity to speak with her She was a vision of heavenly beauty but caused him deep sadness by her refusal to look at him After several attempts at conversation Moses shyly asked Do you believe marriages are made in heaven Yes she answered still looking at the floor And do you Yes I do he replied You see in heaven at the birth of each boy the Lord announces which girl he will marry When I was born my future bride was pointed out to me Then the Lord added But your wife will be humpbacked Right then and there I called out Oh Lord a humpbacked woman would be a tragedy Please Lord give me the hump and let her be beautiful Then Frumtje looked up into his eyes and was stirred by some deep memory She reached out and gave Mendelssohn her hand and later became his devoted wife Barry and Joyce Vissell  The Hugging Judge Dont bug me Hug me Bumper Sticker Lee Shapiro is a retired judge He is also one of the most genuinely loving people we know At one point in his career Lee realized that love is the greatest power there is As a result Lee became a hugger He began offering everybody a hug His colleagues dubbed him the hugging judge as opposed to the hanging judge we suppose The bumper sticker on his car reads Dont bug me Hug me About six years ago Lee created what he calls his Hugger Kit On the outside it reads A heart for a hug The inside contains thirty little red embroidered hearts with stickums on the back Lee will take out his Hugger Kit go around to people and offer them a little red heart in exchange for a hug Lee has become so well known for this that he is often invited to keynote conferences and conventions where he shares his message of unconditional love At a conference in San Francisco the local news media challenged him by saying It is easy to give out hugs here in the conference to people who selfselected to be here But this would never work in the real world They challenged Lee to give away some hugs on the streets of San Francisco Followed by a television crew from the local news station Lee went out onto the street First he approached a woman walking by Hi Im Lee Shapiro the hugging judge Im giving out these hearts in exchange for a hug Sure she replied Too easy challenged the local commentator Lee looked around He saw a meter maid who was being given a hard time by the owner of a BMW to whom she was giving a ticket He marched up to her camera crew in tow and said You look like you could use a hug Im the hugging judge and Im offering you one She accepted The television commentator threw down one final challenge Look here comes a bus San Francisco bus drivers are the toughest crabbiest meanest people in the whole town Lets see you get him to hug you Lee took the challenge As the bus pulled up to the curb Lee said Hi Im Lee Shapiro the hugging judge This has got to be one of the most stressful jobs in the whole world Im offering hugs to people today to lighten the load a  little Would you like one The sixfoottwo 230pound bus driver got out of his seat stepped down and said Why not Lee hugged him gave him a heart and waved goodbye as the bus pulled out The TV crew was speechless Finally the commentator said I have to admit Im very impressed One day Lees friend Nancy Johnston showed up on his doorstep Nancy is a professional clown and she was wearing her clown costume makeup and all Lee grab a bunch of your Hugger Kits and lets go out to the home for the disabled When they arrived at the home they started giving out balloon hats hearts and hugs to the patients Lee was uncomfortable He had never before hugged people who were terminally ill severely retarded or quadriplegic It was definitely a stretch But after a while it became easier with Nancy and Lee acquiring an entourage of doctors nurses and orderlies who followed them from ward to ward After several hours they entered the last ward These were 34 of the worst cases Lee had seen in his life The feeling was so grim it took his heart away But out of their commitment to share their love and to make a difference Nancy and Lee started working their way around the room followed by the entourage of medical staff all of whom by now had hearts on their collars and balloon hats on their heads Finally Lee came to the last person Leonard Leonard was wearing a big white bib which he was drooling on Lee looked at Leonard dribbling onto his bib and said Lets go Nancy Theres no way we can get through to this person Nancy replied Cmon Lee Hes a fellow human being too isnt he Then she placed a funny balloon hat on his head Lee took one of his little red hearts and placed it on Leonards bib He took a deep breath leaned down and gave Leonard a hug All of a sudden Leonard began to squeal Eeeeehh Eeeeeehh Some of the other patients in the room began to clang things together Lee turned to the staff for some sort of explanation only to find that every doctor nurse and orderly was crying Lee asked the head nurse Whats going on Lee will never forget what she said This is the first time in 23 years weve ever seen Leonard smile How simple it is to make a difference in the lives of others Jack Canfield and Mark V Hansen  It Cant Happen Here We need 4 hugs a day for survival We need 8 hugs a day for maintenance We need 12 hugs a day for growth Virginia Satir We always teach people to hug each other in our workshops and seminars Most people respond by saying You could never hug people where I work Are you sure Here is a letter from a graduate of one of our seminars Dear Jack I started out this day in rather a bleak mood My friend Rosalind stopped over and asked me if I was giving hugs today I just grumbled something but then I began to think about hugs and everything during the week I would look at the sheet you gave us on How to Keep the Seminar Alive and I would cringe when I got to the part about giving and getting hugs because I couldnt imagine giving hugs to the people at work Well I decided to make it hugs day and I started giving hugs to the customers who came to my counter It was great to see how people just brightened up An MBA student jumped up on top of the counter and did a dance Some people actually came back and asked for more These two Xerox repair guys who were kind of just walking along not really talking to each other were so surprised they just woke up and suddenly were talking and laughing down the hall It feels like I hugged everybody in the Wharton Business School plus whatever was wrong with me this morning which included some physical pain is all gone Im sorry that this letter is so long but Im just really excited The neatest thing was at one point there were about 10 people all hugging each other out in front of my counter I couldnt believe this was happening Love Pamela Rogers PS On the way home I hugged a policeman on 37th Street He said Wow Policemen never get hugs Are you sure you dont want to throw something at me  Another seminar graduate sent us the following piece on hugging Hugging Is Hugging is healthy It helps the immune system cures depression reduces stress and induces sleep Its invigorating rejuvenating and has no unpleasant side effects Hugging is nothing less than a miracle drug Hugging is all natural It is organic naturally sweet no artificial ingredients nonpolluting environmentally friendly and 100 percent wholesome Hugging is the ideal gift Great for any occasion fun to give and receive shows you care comes with its awn wrapping and of course fully returnable Hugging is practically perfect No batteries to wear out inflationproof nonfattening no monthly payments theftproof and nontaxable Hugging is an underutilized resource with magical powers When we open our hearts and arms we encourage others to do the same Think of the people in your life Are there any words youd like to say Are there any hugs you want to share Are you waiting and hoping someone else will ask first Please dont wait Initiate Charles Faraone Jack Canfield  Who You Are Makes A Difference A teacher in New York decided to honor each of her seniors in high school by telling them the difference they each made Using a process developed by Helice Bridges of Del Mar California she called each student to the front of the class one at a time First she told them how the student made a difference to her and the class Then she presented each of them with a blue ribbon imprinted with gold letters which read Who I Am Makes a Difference Afterwards the teacher decided to do a class project to see what kind of impact recognition would have on a community She gave each of the students three more ribbons and instructed them to go out and spread this acknowledgment ceremony Then they were to follow up on the results see who honored whom and report back to the class in about a week One of the boys in the class went to a junior executive in a nearby company and honored him for helping him with his career planning He gave him a blue ribbon and put it on his shirt Then he gave him two extra ribbons and said Were doing a class project on recognition and wed like you to go out find somebody to honor give them a blue ribbon then give them the extra blue ribbon so they can acknowledge a third person to keep this acknowledgment ceremony going Then please report back to me and tell me what happened Later that day the junior executive went in to see his boss who had been noted by the way as being kind of a grouchy fellow He sat his boss down and he told him that he deeply admired him for being a creative genius The boss seemed very surprised The junior executive asked him if he would accept the gift of the blue ribbon and would he give him permission to put it on him His surprised boss said Well sure The junior executive took the blue ribbon and placed it right on his bosss jacket above his heart As he gave him the last extra ribbon he said Would you do me a favor Would you take this extra ribbon and pass it on by honoring somebody else The young boy who first gave me the ribbons is doing a project in school and we want to keep this recognition ceremony going and find out how it affects people  That night the boss came home to his 14yearold son and sat him down He said The most incredible thing happened to me today I was in my office and one of the junior executives came in and told me he admired me and gave me a blue ribbon for being a creative genius Imagine He thinks Im a creative genius Then he put this blue ribbon that says Who I Am Makes A Difference on my jacket above my heart He gave me an extra ribbon and asked me to find somebody else to honor As I was driving home tonight I started thinking about whom I would honor with this ribbon and I thought about you I want to honor you My days are really hectic and when I come home I dont pay a lot of attention to you Sometimes I scream at you for not getting good enough grades in school and for your bedroom being a mess but somehow tonight I just wanted to sit here and well just let you know that you do make a difference to me Besides your mother you are the most important person in my life Youre a great kid and I love you The startled boy started to sob and sob and he couldnt stop crying His whole body shook He looked up at his father and said through his tears I was planning on committing suicide tomorrow Dad because I didnt think you loved me Now I dont need to Helice Bridges  One At A Time A friend of ours was walking down a deserted Mexican beach at sunset As he walked along he began to see another man in the distance As he grew nearer he noticed that the local native kept leaning down picking something up and throwing it out into the water Time and again he kept hurling things out into the ocean As our friend approached even closer he noticed that the man was picking up starfish that had been washed up on the beach and one at a time he was throwing them back into the water Our friend was puzzled He approached the man and said Good evening friend I was wondering what you are doing Im throwing these starfish back into the ocean You see its low tide right now and all of these starfish have been washed up onto the shore If I dont throw them back into the sea theyll die up here from lack of oxygen I understand my friend replied but there must be thousands of starfish on this beach You cant possibly get to all of them There are simply too many And dont you realize this is probably happening on hundreds of beaches all up and down this coast Cant you see that you cant possibly make a difference The local native smiled bent down and picked up yet another starfish and as he threw it back into the sea he replied Made a difference to that one Jack Canfield and Mark V Hansen  The Gift Bennet Cerf relates this touching story about a bus that was bumping along a back road in the South In one seat a wispy old man sat holding a bunch of fresh flowers Across the aisle was a young girl whose eyes came back again and again to the mans flowers The time came for the old man to get off Impulsively he thrust the flowers into the girls lap I can see you love the flowers he explained and I think my wife would like for you to have them Ill tell her I gave them to you The girl accepted the flowers then watched the old man get off the bus and walk through the gate of a small cemetery Jack Canfield and Mark V Hansen  A Brother Like That A friend of mine named Paul received an automobile from his brother as a Christmas present On Christmas Eve when Paul came out of his office a street urchin was walking around the shiny new car admiring it Is this your car Mister he asked Paul nodded My brother gave it to me for Christmas The boy was astounded You mean your brother gave it to you and it didnt cost you nothing Boy I wish He hesitated Of course Paul knew what he was going to wish for He was going to wish he had a brother like that But what the lad said jarred Paul all the way down to his heels I wish the boy went on that I could be a brother like that Paul looked at the boy in astonishment then impulsively he added Would you like to take a ride in my automobile Oh yes Id love that After a short ride the boy turned and with his eyes aglow said Mister would you mind driving in front of my house Paul smiled a little He thought he knew what the lad wanted He wanted to show his neighbors that he could ride home in a big automobile But Paul was wrong again Will you stop where those two steps are the boy asked He ran up the steps Then in a little while Paul heard him coming back but he was not coming fast He was carrying his little crippled brother He sat him down on the bottom step then sort of squeezed up against him and pointed to the car There she is Buddy just like I told you upstairs His brother gave it to him for Christmas and it didnt cost him a cent And some day Im gonna give you one just like it then you can see for yourself all the pretty things in the Christmas windows that Ive been trying to tell you about Paul got out and lifted the lad to the front seat of his car The shiningeyed older brother climbed in beside him and the three of them began a memorable holiday ride That Christmas Eve Paul learned what Jesus meant when he said It is more blessed to give Dan Clark  On Courage So you think Im courageous she asked Yes I do Perhaps I am But thats because Ive had some inspiring teachers Ill tell you about one of them Many years ago when I worked as a volunteer at Stanford Hospital I got to know a little girl named Liza who was suffering from a rare and serious disease Her only chance of recovery appeared to be a blood transfusion from her fiveyearold brother who had miraculously survived the same disease and had developed the antibodies needed to combat the illness The doctor explained the situation to her little brother and asked the boy if he would be willing to give his blood to his sister I saw him hesitate for only a moment before taking a deep breath and saying Yes Ill do it if it will save Liza As the transfusion progressed he lay in a bed next to his sister and smiled as we all did seeing the color returning to her cheeks Then his face grew pale and his smile faded He looked up at the doctor and asked with a trembling voice Will I start to die right away Being young the boy had misunderstood the doctor he thought he was going to have to give her all his blood Yes Ive learned courage she added because Ive had inspiring teachers Dan Millman  Big Ed When I arrived in the city to present a seminar on ToughMinded Management a small group of people took me to dinner to brief me on the people I would talk to the next day The obvious leader of the group was Big Ed a large burly man with a deep rumbling voice At dinner he informed me that he was a troubleshooter for a huge international organization His job was to go into certain divisions or subsidiaries to terminate the employment of the executive in charge Joe he said Im really looking forward to tomorrow because all of the guys need to listen to a tough guy like you Theyre gonna find out that my style is the right one He grinned and winked I smiled I knew the next day was going to be different from what he was anticipating The next day he sat impassively all through the seminar and left at the end without saying anything to me Three years later I returned to that city to present another management seminar to approximately the same group Big Ed was there again At about ten oclock he suddenly stood up and asked loudly Joe can I say something to these people I grinned and said Sure When anybody is as big as you are Ed he can say anything he wants Big Ed went on to say All of you guys know me and some of you know whats happened to me I want to share it however with all of you Joe I think youll appreciate it by the time Ive finished When I heard you suggest that each of us in order to become really toughminded needed to learn to tell those closest to us that we really loved them I thought it was a bunch of sentimental garbage I wondered what in the world that had to do with being tough You had said toughness is like leather and hardness is like granite that the tough mind is open resilient disciplined and tenacious But I couldnt see what love had to do with it That night as I sat across the living room from my wife your words were still bugging me What kind of courage would it take to tell my wife I loved her Couldnt anybody do it You had also said this should be in the daylight and not in the bedroom I found myself clearing my throat and starting and then stopping My wife looked up and asked me  what I had said and I answered Oh nothing Then suddenly I got up walked across the room nervously pushed her newspaper aside and said Alice I love you For a minute she looked startled Then the tears came to her eyes and she said softly Ed I love you too but this is the first time in 25 years youve said it like that We talked a while about how love if theres enough of it can dissolve all kinds of tensions and suddenly I decided on the spur of the moment to call my oldest son in New York We have never really communicated well When I got him on the phone I blurted out Son youre liable to think Im drunk but Im not I just thought Id call you and tell you I love you There was a pause at his end and then I heard him say quietly Dad I guess Ive known that but its sure good to hear I want you to know I love you too We had a good chat and then I called my youngest son in San Francisco We had been closer I told him the same thing and this too led to a real fine talk like wed never really had As I lay in bed that night thinking I realized that all the things youd talked about that dayreal management nuts and boltstook on extra meaning and I could get a handle on how to apply them if I really understood and practiced toughminded love I began to read books on the subject Sure enough Joe a lot of great people had a lot to say and I began to realize the enormous practicality of applied love in my life both at home and at work As some of you guys here know I really changed the way I work with people I began to listen more and to really hear I learned what it was like to try to get to know peoples strengths rather than dwelling on their weaknesses I began to discover the real pleasure of helping build their confidence Maybe the most important thing of all was that I really began to understand that an excellent way to show love and respect for people was to expect them to use their strengths to meet objectives we had worked out together Joe this is my way of saying thanks Incidentally talk about practical Im now executive vicepresident of the company and they call me a pivotal leader Okay you guys now listen to this guy Joe Batten  Love And The Cabbie I was in New York the other day and rode with a friend in a taxi When we got out my friend said to the driver Thank you for the ride You did a superb job of driving The taxi driver was stunned for a second Then he said Are you a wise guy or something No my dear man and Im not putting you on I admire the way you keep cool in heavy traffic Yeah the driver said and drove off What was that all about I asked I am trying to bring love back to New York he said I believe its the only thing that can save the city How can one man save New York Its not one man I believe I have made that taxi drivers day Suppose he has 20 fares Hes going to be nice to those 20 fares because someone was nice to him Those fares in turn will be kinder to their employees or shopkeepers or waiters or even their own families Eventually the goodwill could spread to at least 1000 people Now that isnt bad is it But youre depending on that taxi driver to pass your goodwill to others Im not depending on it my friend said Im aware that the system isnt foolproof so I might deal with ten different people today If out of ten I can make three happy then eventually I can indirectly influence the attitudes of 3000 more It sounds good on paper I admitted but Im not sure it works in practice Nothing is lost if it doesnt It didnt take any of my time to tell that man he was doing a good job He neither received a larger tip nor a smaller tip If it fell on deaf ears so what Tomorrow there will be another taxi driver I can try to make happy Youre some kind of a nut I said That shows how cynical you have become I have made a study of this The thing that seems to be lacking besides money of course for our postal employees is that no one tells people who work for the post office what a good job theyre doing But theyre not doing a good job  Theyre not doing a good job because they feel no one cares if they do or not Why shouldnt someone say a kind word to them We were walking past a structure in the process of being built and passed five workmen eating their lunch My friend stopped Thats a magnificent job you men have done It must be difficult and dangerous work The workmen eyed my friend suspiciously When will it be finished June a man grunted Ah That really is impressive You must all be very proud We walked away I said to him I havent seen anyone like you since Man of La Mancha When those men digest my words they will feel better for it Somehow the city will benefit from their happiness But you cant do this all alone I protested Youre just one man The most important thing is not to get discouraged Making people in the city become kind again is not an easy job but if I can enlist other people in my campaign  You just winked at a very plainlooking woman I said Yes I know he replied And if shes a schoolteacher her class will be in for a fantastic day Art Buchwald  A Simple Gesture Everybody can be great because anybody can serve You dont have to have a college degree to serve You dont have to make your subject and verb agree to serve You only need a heart full of grace A soul generated by love Martin Luther King Jr Mark was walking home from school one day when he noticed the boy ahead of him had tripped and dropped all of the books he was carrying along with two sweaters a baseball bat a glove and a small tape recorder Mark knelt down and helped the boy pick up the scattered articles Since they were going the same way he helped to carry part of the burden As they walked Mark discovered the boys name was Bill that he loved video games baseball and history that he was having a lot of trouble with his other subjects and that he had just broken up with his girlfriend They arrived at Bills home first and Mark was invited in for a Coke and to watch some television The afternoon passed pleasantly with a few laughs and some shared small talk then Mark went home They continued to see each other around school had lunch together once or twice then both graduated from junior high school They ended up in the same high school where they had brief contacts over the years Finally the long awaited senior year came and three weeks before graduation Bill asked Mark if they could talk Bill reminded him of the day years ago when they had first met Do you ever wonder why I was carrying so many things home that day asked Bill You see I cleaned out my locker because I didnt want to leave a mess for anyone else I had stored away some of my mothers sleeping pills and I was going home to commit suicide But after we spent some time together talking and laughing I realized that if I had killed myself I would have missed that time and so many others that might follow So you see Mark when you picked up my books that day you did a lot more You saved my life John W Schlatter  The Smile Smile at each other smile at your wife smile at your husband smile at your children smile at each otherit doesnt matter who it isand that will help you to grow up in greater love for each other Mother Teresa Many Americans are familiar with The Little Prince a wonderful book by Antoine de SaintExupery This is a whimsical and fabulous book and works as a childrens story as well as a thoughtprovoking adult fable Far fewer are aware of SaintExuperys other writings novels and short stories SaintExupery was a fighter pilot who fought against the Nazis and was killed in action Before World War II he fought in the Spanish Civil War against the fascists He wrote a fascinating story based on that experience entitled The Smile Le Sourire It is this story which Id like to share with you now It isnt clear whether or not he meant this to be autobiographical or fiction I choose to believe it is the former He said that he was captured by the enemy and thrown into a jail cell He was sure that from the contemptuous looks and rough treatment he received from his jailers he would be executed the next day From here Ill tell the story as I remember it in my own words I was sure that I was to be killed I became terribly nervous and distraught I fumbled in my pockets to see if there were any cigarettes which had escaped their search I found one and because of my shaking hands I could barely get it to my lips But I had no matches they had taken those I looked through the bars at my jailer He did not make eye contact with me After all one does not make eye contact with a thing a corpse I called out to him Have you got a light por favor He looked at me shrugged and came over to light my cigarette As he came close and lit the match his eyes inadvertently locked with mine At that moment I smiled I dont know why I did that Perhaps it was nervousness perhaps it was because when you get very close one to another it is very hard not to smile In any case I smiled In that instant it was as though a spark jumped across the gap between our two hearts our two human souls I know he didnt want to but my smile leaped through the bars and generated a smile on his lips too He lit my cigarette but stayed near looking at me directly in the eyes and continuing to smile I kept smiling at him now aware of him as a person and not just a jailer And his looking at me seemed to have a new dimension too Do you have kids he asked Yes here here I took out my wallet and nervously fumbled for the pictures of my family He too took out the pictures of his ninos and began to talk about his plans and hopes for them My eyes filled with tears I said that I feared that Id never see my family again never have the chance to see them grow up Tears came to his eyes too Suddenly without another word he unlocked my cell and silently led me out Out of the jail quietly and by back routes out of the town There at the edge of town he released me And without another word he turned back toward the town My life was saved by a smile Yes the smilethe unaffected unplanned natural connection between people I tell this story in my work because Id like people to consider that underneath all the layers we construct to protect ourselves our dignity our titles our degrees our status and our need to be seen in certain waysunderneath all that remains the authentic essential self Im not afraid to call it the soul I really believe that if that part of you and that part of me could recognize each other we wouldnt be enemies We couldnt have hate or envy or fear I sadly conclude that all those other layers which we so carefully construct through our lives distance and insulate us from truly contacting others SaintExuperys story speaks of that magic moment when two souls recognize each other Ive had just a few moments like that Falling in love is one example And looking at a baby Why do we smile when we see a baby Perhaps its because we see someone without all the defensive layers someone whose smile for us we know to be fully genuine and without guile And that babysoul inside us smiles wistfully in recognition Hanoch McCarty  Amy Graham After flying all night from Washington DC I was tired as I arrived at the Mile High Church in Denver to conduct three services and hold a workshop on prosperity consciousness As I entered the church Dr Fred Vogt asked me Do you know about the MakeAWish Foundation Yes I replied Well Amy Graham has been diagnosed as having terminal leukemia They gave her three days Her dying wish was to attend your services I was shocked I felt a combination of elation awe and doubt I couldnt believe it I thought kids who were dying would want to go see Disneyland meet Sylvester Stallone Mr T or Arnold Schwarzenegger Surely they wouldnt want to spend their final days listening to Mark Victor Hansen Why would a kid with only a few days to live want to come hear a motivational speaker Suddenly my thoughts were interrupted Heres Amy Vogt said as he put her frail hand in mine Before me stood a 17yearold girl wearing a bright red and orange turban to cover her head which was bald from all of the chemotherapy treatments Her frail body was bent and weak She said My two goals were to graduate from high school and to attend your sermon My doctors didnt believe I could do either They didnt think Id have enough energy I got discharged into my parents care This is my mom and dad Tears welled in my eyes I was choked up My equilibrium was being shaken I was totally moved I cleared my throat smiled and said You and your folks are our guests Thanks for wanting to come We hugged dabbed our eyes and separated Ive attended many healing seminars in the United States Canada Malaysia New Zealand and Australia Ive watched the best healers at work and Ive studied researched listened pondered and questioned what worked why and how That Sunday afternoon I held a seminar that Amy and her parents attended The audience was packed to overflowing with over a thousand attendees eager to learn grow and become more fully human I humbly asked the audience if they wanted to learn a healing process that might serve them for life From the stage it appeared that everyones hand was raised high in the air They unanimously wanted to learn  I taught the audience how to vigorously rub their hands together separate them by two inches and feel the healing energy Then I paired them off with a partner to feel the healing energy emanating from themselves to another I said If you need a healing accept one here and now The audience was in alignment and it was an ecstatic feeling I explained that everyone has healing energy and healing potential Five percent of us have it so dramatically pouring forth from our hands that we could make it our profession I said This morning I was introduced to Amy Graham a 17yearold whose final wish was to be at this seminar I want to bring her up here and let you all send healing lifeforce energy toward her Perhaps we can help She did not request it I am just doing this spontaneously because it feels right The audience chanted Yes Yes Yes Yes Amys dad led her up onto the stage She looked frail from all of the chemotherapy too much bed rest and an absolute lack of exercise The doctors hadnt let her walk for the two weeks prior to this seminar I had the group warm up their hands and send her healing energy after which they gave her a tearful standing ovation Two weeks later she called to say that her doctor had discharged her after a total remission Two years later she called to say she was married I have learned never to underestimate the healing power we all have It is always there to be used for the highest good We just have to remember to use it Mark V Hansen  A Story For Valentines Day Larry and Jo Ann were an ordinary couple They lived in an ordinary house on an ordinary street Like any other ordinary couple they struggled to make ends meet and to do the right things for their children They were ordinary in yet another waythey had their squabbles Much of their conversation concerned what was wrong in their marriage and who was to blame Until one day when a most extraordinary event took place You know Jo Ann Ive got a magic chest of drawers Every time I open them theyre full of socks and underwear Larry said I want to thank you for filling them all these years Jo Ann stared at her husband over the top of her glasses What do you want Larry Nothing I just want you to know I appreciate those magic drawers This wasnt the first time Larry had done something odd so Jo Ann pushed the incident out of her mind until a few days later Jo Ann thank you for recording so many correct check numbers in the ledger this month You put down the right numbers 15 out of 16 times Thats a record Disbelieving what she had heard Jo Ann looked up from her mending Larry youre always complaining about my recording the wrong check numbers Why stop now No reason I just wanted you to know I appreciate the effort youre making Jo Ann shook her head and went back to her mending Whats got into him she mumbled to herself Nevertheless the next day when Jo Ann wrote a check at the grocery store she glanced at her checkbook to confirm that she had put down the right check number Why do I suddenly care about those dumb check numbers she asked herself She tried to disregard the incident but Larrys strange behavior intensified Jo Ann that was a great dinner he said one evening I appreciate all your effort Why in the past 15 years Ill bet youve fixed over 14000 meals for me and the kids  Then Gee Jo Ann the house looks spiffy Youve really worked hard to get it looking so good And even Thanks Jo Ann for just being you I really enjoy your company Jo Ann was growing worried Wheres the sarcasm the criticism she wondered Her fears that something peculiar was happening to her husband were confirmed by 16yearold Shelly who complained Dads gone bonkers Mom He just told me I looked nice With all this makeup and these sloppy clothes he still said it Thats not Dad Mom Whats wrong with him Whatever was wrong Larry didnt get over it Day in and day out he continued focusing on the positive Over the weeks Jo Ann grew more accustomed to her mates unusual behavior and occasionally even gave him a grudging Thank you She prided herself on taking it all in stride until one day something so peculiar happened she became completely discombobulated I want you to take a break Larry said I am going to do the dishes So please take your hands off that frying pan and leave the kitchen Long long pause Thank you Larry Thank you very much Jo Anns step was now a little lighter her selfconfidence higher and once in a while she hummed She didnt seem to have as many blue moods anymore I rather like Larrys new behavior she thought That would be the end of the story except one day another most extraordinary event took place This time it was Jo Ann who spoke Larry she said I want to thank you for going to work and providing for us all these years I dont think Ive ever told you how much I appreciate it Larry has never revealed the reason for his dramatic change of behavior no matter how hard Jo Ann has pushed for an answer and so it will likely remain one of lifes mysteries But its one Im thankful to live with You see I am Jo Ann Jo Ann Larsen Deseret News  Carpe Diem One who stands as a shining example of courageous expression is John Keating the transformative teacher portrayed by Robin Williams in Dead Poets Society In this masterful motion picture Keating takes a group of regimented uptight and spiritually impotent students at a rigid boarding school and inspires them to make their lives extraordinary These young men as Keating points out to them have lost sight of their dreams and ambitions They are automatically living out their parents programs and expectations for them They plan to become doctors lawyers and bankers because that is what their parents have told them they are going to do But these dry fellows have given hardly any thought to what their hearts are calling them to express An early scene in the movie shows Mr Keating taking the boys down to the school lobby where a trophy case displays photos of earlier graduating classes Look at these pictures boys Keating tells the students The young men you behold had the same fire in their eyes that you do They planned to take the world by storm and make something magnificent of their lives That was 70 years ago Now they are all pushing up daisies How many of them really lived out their dreams Did they do what they set out to accomplish Then Mr Keating leans into the cluster of preppies and whispers audibly Carpe diem Seize the day At first the students do not know what to make of this strange teacher But soon they ponder the importance of his words They come to respect and revere Mr Keating who has given them a new visionor returned their original ones All of us are walking around with some kind of birthday card we would like to givesome personal expression of joy creativity or aliveness that we are hiding under our shirt One character in the movie Knox Overstreet has a terminal crush on a gorgeous girl The only problem is that she is the girlfriend of a famous jock Knox is infatuated with this lovely creature down to a cellular level but he lacks the confidence to approach her Then he remembers Mr Keatings advice Seize the day Knox realizes he cannot just go on dreamingif he wants her he is going to have to do something about it And so he does Boldly and poetically he declares to her his most sensitive feelings In the process he gets turned away by her punched in the nose by her boyfriend and faces embarrassing setbacks But Knox is  unwilling to forsake his dream so he pursues his hearts desire Ultimately she feels the genuineness of his caring and opens her heart to him Although Knox is not especially goodlooking or popular the girl is won over by the power of his sincere intention He has made his life extraordinary I had a chance to practice seizing the day myself I developed a crush on a cute girl I met in a pet store She was younger than I she led a very different lifestyle and we did not have a great deal to talk about But somehow none of this seemed to matter I enjoyed being with her and I felt a sparkle in her presence And it seemed to me she enjoyed my company as well When I learned her birthday was coming up I decided to ask her out On the threshold of calling her I sat and looked at the phone for about half an hour Then I dialed and hung up before it rang I felt like a high school boy bouncing between excited anticipation and fear of rejection A voice from hell kept telling me that she would not like me and that I had a lot of nerve asking her out But I felt too enthusiastic about being with her to let those fears stop me Finally I got up the nerve to ask her She thanked me for asking and told me she already had plans I felt shot down The same voice that told me not to call advised me to give up before I was further embarrassed But I was intent on seeing what this attraction was about There was more inside of me that wanted to come to life I had feelings for this woman and I had to express them I went to the mall and got her a pretty birthday card on which I wrote a poetic note I walked around the corner to the pet shop where I knew she was working As I approached the door that same disturbing voice cautioned me What if she doesnt like you What if she rejects you Feeling vulnerable I stuffed the card under my shirt I decided that if she showed me signs of affection I would give it to her if she was cool to me I would leave the card hidden This way I would not be at risk and would avoid rejection or embarrassment We talked for a while and I did not get any signs one way or the other from her Feeling illatease I began to make my exit As I approached the door however another voice spoke to me It came in a whisper not unlike that of Mr Keating It prompted me Remember Knox Overstreet Carpe diem Here I was confronted with my aspiration to fully express my heart and my resistance to face the insecurity of emotional nakedness How can I go around telling other people to live their vision I asked myself when I am not living my own Besides whats the worst thing that could  happen Any woman would be delighted to receive a poetic birthday card I decided to seize the day As I made that choice I felt a surge of courage course through my veins There was indeed power in intention 1 felt more satisfied and at peace with myself than I had in a long time I needed to learn to open my heart and give love without requiring anything in return I took the card out from under my shirt turned around walked up to the counter and gave it to her As I handed it to her I felt an incredible aliveness and excitementplus fear Fritz Perls said that fear is excitement without breath But I did it And do you know what She was not particularly impressed She said Thanks and put the card aside without even opening it My heart sank I felt disappointed and rejected Getting no response seemed even worse than a direct brushoff I offered a polite goodbye and walked out of the store Then something amazing happened I began to feel exhilarated A huge rush of internal satisfaction welled up within me and surged through my whole being I had expressed my heart and that felt fantastic I had stretched beyond fear and gone out on the dance floor Yes I had been a little clumsy but I did it Emmet Fox said Do it trembling if you must but do it I had put my heart on the line without demanding a guarantee of the results I did not give in order to get something back I opened my feelings to her without an attachment to a particular response The dynamics that are required to make any relationship work Just keep putting your love out there My exhilaration deepened to a warm bliss I felt more satisfied and at peace with myself than I had in a long time I realized the purpose of the whole experience I needed to learn to open my heart and give love without requiring anything in return This experience was not about creating a relationship with this woman It was about deepening my relationship with myself And I did it Mr Keating would have been proud But most of all I was proud I have not seen the girl much since then but that experience changed my life Through that simple interaction I clearly saw the dynamics that are required to make any relationship and perhaps the whole world work Just keep putting your love out there We believe that we are hurt when we dont receive love But that is not what hurts us Our pain comes when we do not give love We were born  to love You might say that we are divinely created love machines We function most powerfully when we are giving love The world has led us to believe that our wellbeing is dependent on other people loving us But this is the kind of upsidedown thinking that has caused so many of our problems The truth is that our wellbeing is dependent on our giving love It is not about what comes back it is about what goes out Alan Cohen  I Know You Youre Just Like Me One of our closest friends is Stan Dale Stan teaches a seminar on love and relationships called Sex Love and Intimacy Several years ago in an effort to learn what the people in the Soviet Union were really like he took 29 people to the Soviet Union for two weeks When he wrote about his experiences in his newsletter we were deeply touched by the following anecdote While walking through a park in the industrial city of Kharkov I spotted an old Russian veteran of World War II They are easily identified by the medals and ribbons they still proudly display on their shirts and jackets This is not an act of egotism It is their countrys way of honoring those who helped save Russia even though 20 million Russians were killed by the Nazis I went up to this old man sitting with his wife and said Druzhba i mir friendship and peace The man looking at me as if in disbelief took the button we had made for the trip and said Friendship in Russian and showed a map of the US and the USSR being held by loving hands and said Americanski I replied Da Americanski Druzhba i mir He clasped both my hands as if we were long lost brothers and repeated again Americanski This time there was recognition and love in his statement For the next few minutes he and his wife spoke in Russian as if I understood every word and I spoke English as if I knew he would understand You know what Neither of us understood a word but we surely understood each other We hugged and laughed and cried all the while saying Druzhba i mir Americanski I love you I am proud to be in your country we do not want war I love you After about five minutes we said goodbye and the seven of us in our little group walked on About 15 minutes later some considerable distance on this same old veteran caught up with us He came up to me took off his Order of Lenin medal probably his most prized possession and pinned it to my jacket He then kissed me on the lips and gave me one of the warmest most loving hugs I have ever received Then we both cried looked into each others eyes for the longest time and said Dossvedanya goodbye The above story is symbolic of our entire Citizen Diplomacy trip to the Soviet Union Every day we met and touched hundreds of people in  every possible and impossible setting Neither the Russians nor ourselves will ever be the same There are now hundreds of school children from the three schools we visited who will not be quite so ready to think of Americans as people who want to nuke them We danced sang and played with children of every age and then we hugged kissed and shared presents They gave us flowers cakes buttons paintings dolls but most importantly their hearts and open minds More than once we were invited to be members of wedding parties and no biological family member could have been more warmly accepted greeted and feted than we were We hugged kissed danced and drank champagne schnapps and vodka with the bride and groom as well as Momma and Poppa and the rest of the family In Kursk we were hosted by seven Russian families who volunteered to take us in for a wonderful evening of food drink and conversation Four hours later none of us wanted to part Our group now has a complete new family in Russia The following night our family was feted by us at our hotel The band played until almost midnight and guess what Once again we ate drank talked danced and cried when it came time to say goodbye We danced every dance as if we were passionate lovers which is exactly what we were I could go on forever about our experiences and yet there would be no way to convey to you exactly how we felt How would you feel when you arrived at your hotel in Moscow if there were a telephone message waiting for you written in Russian from Mikhail Gorbachevs office saying he regretted he could not meet with you that weekend because he would be out of town but instead he had arranged for your entire group to meet for two hours in a roundtable discussion with about a halfdozen members of the Central Committee We had an extremely frank discussion about everything including sex How would you feel if more than a dozen old ladies wearing babushkas came down from the steps of their apartment buildings and hugged and kissed you How would you feel when your guides Tanya and Natasha told you and the whole group that they had never seen anyone like you And when we left all 30 of us cried because we had fallen in love with these fabulous women and they with us Yes how would you feel Probably just like us  Each of us had our own experience of course but the collective experience bears out one thing for certain The only way we are ever going to ensure peace on this planet is to adopt the entire world as our family We are going to have to hug them and kiss them And dance and play with them And we are going to have to sit and talk and walk and cry with them Because when we do well be able to see that indeed everyone is beautiful and we all complement each other so beautifully and we would all be poorer without each other Then the saying I know you youre just like me will take on a megameaning of This is my family and I will stand by them no matter what Stan Dale  Another Way The train clanked and rattled through the suburbs of Tokyo on a drowsy spring afternoon Our car was comparatively emptya few housewives with their kids in tow some old folks going shopping I gazed absently at the drab houses and dusty hedgerows At one station the doors opened and suddenly the afternoon quiet was shattered by a man bellowing violent incomprehensible curses The man staggered into our car He wore laborers clothing and was big drunk and dirty Screaming he swung at a woman holding a baby The blow sent her spinning into the laps of an elderly couple It was a miracle that the baby was unharmed Terrified the couple jumped up and scrambled toward the other end of the car The laborer aimed a kick at the retreating back of the old woman but missed as she scuttled to safety This so enraged the drunk that he grabbed the metal pole in the center of the car and tried to wrench it out of its stanchion I could see that one of his hands was cut and bleeding The train lurched ahead the passengers frozen with fear I stood up I was young then some 20 years ago and in pretty good shape Id been putting in a solid eight hours of Aikido training nearly every day for the past three years I liked to throw and grapple I thought I was tough The trouble was my martial skill was untested in actual combat As students of Aikido we were not allowed to fight Aikido my teacher had said again and again is the art of reconciliation Whoever has the mind to fight has broken his connection with the universe If you try to dominate people youre already defeated We study how to resolve conflict not how to start it I listened to his words I tried hard I even went so far as to cross the street to avoid the chimpira the pinball punks who lounged around the train stations My forbearance exalted me I felt both tough and holy In my heart however I wanted an absolutely legitimate opportunity whereby I might save the innocent by destroying the guilty This is it I said to myself as I got to my feet People are in danger If I dont do something fast somebody will probably get hurt Seeing me stand up the drunk recognized a chance to focus his rage Aha he roared A foreigner You need a lesson in Japanese manners  I held on lightly to the commuter strap overhead and gave him a slow look of disgust and dismissal I planned to take this turkey apart but he had to make the first move I wanted him mad so I pursed my lips and blew him an insolent kiss All right he hollered Youre gonna get a lesson He gathered himself for a rush at me A fraction of a second before he could move someone shouted Hey It was earsplitting I remember the strangely joyous lilting quality of itas though you and a friend had been searching diligently for something and he had suddenly stumbled upon it Hey I wheeled to my left the drunk spun to his right We both stared down at a little old Japanese man He must have been well into his seventies this tiny gentleman sitting there immaculate in his kimono He took no notice of me but beamed delightedly at the laborer as though he had a most important most welcome secret to share Cmere the old man said in an easy vernacular beckoning to the drunk Cmere and talk with me He waved his hands lightly The big man followed as if on a string He planted his feet belligerently in front of the old gentleman and roared above the clacking wheels Why the hell should I talk to you The drunk now had his back to me If his elbow moved so much as a millimeter Id drop him in his socks The old man continued to beam at the laborer Whatcha been drinkin he asked his eyes sparkling with interest I been drinkin sake the laborer bellowed back and its none of your business Flecks of spittle spattered the old man Oh thats wonderful the old man said absolutely wonderful You see I love sake too Every night me and my wife shes 76 you know we warm up a little bottle of sake and take it out into the garden and we sit on an old wooden bench We watch the sun go down and we look to see how our persimmon tree is doing My greatgrandfather planted that tree and we worry about whether it will recover from those ice storms we had last winter Our tree has done better than I expected though especially when you consider the poor quality of the soil It is gratifying to watch when we take our sake and go out to enjoy the eveningeven when it rains He looked up at the laborer eyes twinkling As he struggled to follow the old man his face began to soften His fists slowly unclenched Yeah he said I love persimmons too His voice trailed off  Yes said the old man smiling and Im sure you have a wonderful wife No replied the laborer My wife died Very gently swaying with the motion of the train the big man began to sob I dont got no wife I dont got no home I dont got no job Im so ashamed of myself Tears rolled down his cheeks a spasm of despair rippled through his body As I stood there in my wellscrubbed youthful innocence my makethisworldsafefordemocracy righteousness I felt dirtier than he was Then the train arrived at my stop As the doors opened I heard the old man cluck sympathetically My my he said that is a difficult predicament indeed Sit down here and tell me about it I turned my head for one last look The laborer was sprawled on the seat with his head in the old mans lap The old man was softly stroking the filthy matted hair As the train pulled away I sat down on a bench in the station What I had wanted to do with muscle had been accomplished with kind words I had just seen Aikido in action and the essence of it was love I would have to practice the art with an entirely different spirit It would be a long time before I could speak about the resolution of conflict Terry Dobson  The Gentlest Need At least once a day our old black cat comes to one of us in a way that weve all come to see as a special request It does not mean he wants to be fed or to be let out or anything of that sort His need is for something very different If you have a lap handy hell jump into it if you dont hes likely to stand there looking wistful until you make him one Once in it he begins to vibrate almost before you stroke his back scratch his chin and tell him over and over what a good kitty he is Then his motor really revs up he squirms to get comfortable he makes big hands Every once in a while one of his purrs gets out of control and turns into a snort He looks at you with wide open eyes of adoration and he gives you the cats long slow blink of ultimate trust After a while little by little he quiets down If he senses that its all right he may stay in your lap for a cozy nap But he is just as likely to hop down and stroll away about his business Either way hes all right Our daughter puts it simply Blackie needs to be purred In our household he isnt the only one who has that need I share it and so does my wife We know the need isnt exclusive to any one age group Still because I am a schoolman as well as a parent I associate it especially with youngsters with their quick impulsive need for a hug a warm lap a hand held out a coverlet tucked in not because anythings wrong not because anything needs doing just because thats the way they are There are a lot of things Id like to do for all children If I could do just one it would be this to guarantee every child everywhere at least one good purring every day Kids like cats need time to purr Fred T Wilhelms  Bopsy The 26yearold mother stared down at her son who was dying of terminal leukemia Although her heart was filled with sadness she also had a strong feeling of determination Like any parent she wanted her son to grow up and fulfill all his dreams Now that was no longer possible The leukemia would see to that But she still wanted her sons dreams to come true She took her sons hand and asked Bopsy did you ever think about what you wanted to be when you grew up Did you ever dream and wish about what you would do with your life Mommy I always wanted to be a fireman when I grew up Mom smiled back and said Lets see if we can make your wish come true Later that day she went to her local fire department in Phoenix Arizona where she met Fireman Bob who had a heart as big as Phoenix She explained her sons final wish and asked if it might be possible to give her sixyearold son a ride around the block on a fire engine Fireman Bob said Look we can do better than that If youll have your son ready at seven oclock Wednesday morning well make him an honorary fireman for the whole day He can come down to the fire station eat with us go out on all the fire calls the whole nine yards And if youll give us his sizes well get a real fire uniform made for him with a real fire hatnot a toy onewith the emblem of the Phoenix Fire Department on it a yellow slicker like we wear and rubber boots Theyre all manufactured right here in Phoenix so we can get them fast Three days later Fireman Bob picked up Bopsy dressed him in his fire uniform and escorted him from his hospital bed to the waiting hook and ladder truck Bopsy got to sit up on the back of the truck and help steer it back to the fire station He was in heaven There were three fire calls in Phoenix that day and Bopsy got to go out on all three calls He rode in the different fire engines the paramedics van and even the fire chiefs car He was also videotaped for the local news program Having his dream come true with all the love and attention that was lavished upon him so deeply touched Bopsy that he lived three months longer than any doctor thought possible  One night all of his vital signs began to drop dramatically and the head nurse who believed in the Hospice concept that no one should die alone began to call the family members to the hospital Then she remembered the day Bopsy had spent as a fireman so she called the fire chief and asked if it would be possible to send a fireman in uniform to the hospital to be with Bopsy as he made his transition The chief replied We can do better than that Well be there in five minutes Will you please do me a favor When you hear the sirens screaming and see the lights flashing will you announce over the PA system that there is not a fire Its just the fire department coming to see one of its finest members one more time And will you open the window to his room Thanks About five minutes later a hook and ladder truck arrived at the hospital extended its ladder up to Bopsys third floor open window and 14 firemen and two firewomen climbed up the ladder into Bopsys room With his mothers permission they hugged him and held him and told him how much they loved him With his dying breath Bopsy looked up at the fire chief and said Chief am I really a fireman now Bopsy you are the chief said With those words Bopsy smiled and closed his eyes for the last time Jack Canfield and Mark V Hansen  Puppies For Sale A store owner was tacking a sign above his door that read Puppies For Sale Signs like that have a way of attracting small children and sure enough a little boy appeared under the store owners sign How much are you going to sell the puppies for he asked The store owner replied Anywhere from 30 to 50 The little boy reached in his pocket and pulled out some change I have 237 he said Can I please look at them The store owner smiled and whistled and out of the kennel came Lady who ran down the aisle of his store followed by five teeny tiny balls of fur One puppy was lagging considerably behind Immediately the little boy singled out the lagging limping puppy and said Whats wrong with that little dog The store owner explained that the veterinarian had examined the little puppy and had discovered it didnt have a hip socket It would always limp It would always be lame The little boy became excited That is the little puppy that I want to buy The store owner said No you dont want to buy that little dog If you really want him Ill just give him to you The little boy got quite upset He looked straight into the store owners eyes pointing his finger and said I dont want you to give him to me That little dog is worth every bit as much as all the other dogs and Ill pay full price In fact Ill give you 237 now and 50 cents a month until I have him paid for The store owner countered You really dont want to buy this little dog He is never going to be able to run and jump and play with you like the other puppies To this the little boy reached down and rolled up his pant leg to reveal a badly twisted crippled left leg supported by a big metal brace He looked up at the store owner and softly replied Well I dont run so well myself and the little puppy will need someone who understands Dan Clark Weathering the Storm  LEARNING TO LOVE YOURSELF Oliver

SaintExupery In the fall of 1988 my wife Georgia and I were invited to give a presentation on selfesteem and peak performance at a conference in Hong Kong Since we had never been to the Far East before we decided to extend our trip and visit Thailand When we arrived in Bangkok we decided to take a tour of the citys most famous Buddhist temples Along with our interpreter and driver Georgia and I visited numerous Buddhist temples that day but after a while they all began to blur in our memories However there was one temple that left an indelible impression in our hearts and minds It is called the Temple of the Golden Buddha The temple itself is very small probably no larger than thirty feet by thirty feet But as we entered we were stunned by the presence of a tenandahalffoot tall solidgold Buddha It weighs over twoandahalf tons and is valued at approximately one hundred and ninetysix million dollars It was quite an awesome sightthe kindly gentle yet imposing solidgold Buddha smiling down at us As we immersed ourselves in the normal sightseeing tasks taking pictures while oohing and ahhing over the statue I walked over to a glass case that contained a large piece of clay about eight inches thick and twelve inches wide Next to the glass case was a typewritten page describing the history of this magnificent piece of art Back in 1957 a group of monks from a monastery had to relocate a clay Buddha from their temple to a new location The monastery was to be relocated to make room for the development of a highway through  Bangkok When the crane began to lift the giant idol the weight of it was so tremendous that it began to crack Whats more rain began to fall The head monk who was concerned about damage to the sacred Buddha decided to lower the statue back to the ground and cover it with a large canvas tarpto protect it from the rain Later that evening the head monk went to check on the Buddha He shined his flashlight under the tarp to see if the Buddha was staying dry As the light reached the crack he noticed a little gleam shining back and thought it strange As he took a closer look at this gleam of light he wondered if there might be something underneath the clay He went to fetch a chisel and hammer from the monastery and began to chip away at the clay As he knocked off shards of clay the little gleam grew brighter and bigger Many hours of labor went by before the monk stood face to face with the extraordinary solidgold Buddha Historians believe that several hundred years before the head monks discovery the Burmese army was about to invade Thailand then called Siam The Siamese monks realizing that their country would soon be attacked covered their precious golden Buddha with an outer covering of clay in order to keep their treasure from being looted by the Burmese Unfortunately it appears that the Burmese slaughtered all the Siamese monks and the wellkept secret of the golden Buddha remained intact until that fateful day in 1957 As we flew home on Cathay Pacific Airlines I began to think to myself We are all like the clay Buddha covered with a shell of hardness created out of fear and yet underneath each of us is a golden Buddha a golden Christ or a golden essence which is our real self Somewhere along the way between the ages of two and nine we begin to cover up our golden essence our natural self Much like the monk with the hammer and the chisel our task now is to discover our true essence once again Jack Canfield  Start With Yourself The following words were written on the tomb of an Anglican Bishop in the Crypts of Westminister Abbey When I was young and free and my imagination had no limits I dreamed of changing the world As I grew older and wiser I discovered the world would not change so I shortened my sights somewhat and decided to change only my country But it too seemed immovable As I grew into my twilight years in one last desperate attempt I settled for changing only my family those closest to me but alas they would have none of it And now as I lie on my deathbed I suddenly realize If I had only changed my self first then by example I would have changed my family From their inspiration and encouragement I would then have been able to better my country and who knows I may have even changed the world Anonymous  Nothing But The Truth David Casstevens of the Dallas Morning

asked Yes Your Honor What position Center Your Honor How good a center Szymanski squirmed in his seat but said firmly Sir Im the best center Notre Dame has ever had Coach Frank Leahy who was in the

to himself Im the greatest player ever He swung at the ball again and again he missed He paused a moment to examine bat and ball carefully Then once again he threw the ball into the air and said Im

myself for a fulfilling life I am me In all the world there is no one else exactly like me There are people who have some parts like me but no one adds up exactly like me Therefore everything that comes out of me is authentically mine because I alone choose it I own everything about memy body including everything it does my mind including all my thoughts and ideas my eyes including the images

voice loud and soft all my actions whether they be to others or myself I own my fantasies my dreams my hopes my fears I own all my triumphs and successes all my failures and mistakes Because I own all of me I can become intimately acquainted with me By so doing I can love me and be friendly with me in all my parts I can then make it possible for all of me to work in my best interests I know there are aspects about myself that puzzle me and other aspects that I do not know But as long as I am friendly and loving to myself I can courageously and hopefully look for the solutions to the puzzles and for ways to find out more about me However I look and sound whatever I say and do and whatever I think and feel at a given moment in time is me This is authentic and represents where I am at that moment in time When I review later how I looked and sounded what I said and did and how I thought and felt some parts may turn out to be unfitting I can discard that which is unfitting and keep that which proved fitting and invent something new for that which I discarded I can see hear feel think say and do I have the tools to survive to be close to others to be productive to make sense and order

could smell her before I rounded the entrance to where she slept standing up by the public phones I smelled the urine that seeped through the layers of her dirty clothing and the decay from her nearly toothless mouth If she was not asleep she mumbled incoherently Now they close the post office at six to keep the homeless out so she curls up on the sidewalk talking to herself her mouth flapping open as though unhinged her smells diminished by the soft breeze One Thanksgiving we had so much food left over I packed it up excused myself from the others and drove over to Fifth Street It was a frigid night Leaves were swirling around the streets and hardly anyone was out all but a few of the luckless in some warm home or shelter But I knew I would find her She was dressed as she always was even in summer The warm woolly layers concealing her old bent body Her bony hands clutched the precious shopping cart She was squatting against a wire fence in front of the playground next to the post office Why didnt she choose some place more protected from the wind I thought and assumed she was so crazy she did not have the sense to huddle in a doorway I pulled my shiny car to the curb rolled down the window and said Mother would you and was shocked at the word Mother But she was is in some way I cannot grasp I said again Mother Ive brought you some food Would you like some turkey and stuffing and apple pie At this the old woman looked at me and said quite clearly and distinctly her two loose lower teeth wobbling as she spoke Oh thank you very much but Im quite full now Why dont you take it to someone who really needs it Her words were clear her manners gracious Then I was dismissed Her head sank into her rags again Bobbie Probstein  ResponseAbility the game we play is lets pretend and

mind With what are your children living Dorothy L Nolte  Why I Chose My Father To Be My Dad I grew up on a beautiful sprawling farm in Iowa raised by parents who are often described as the salt of the earth and the backbone of the community They were all the things we know good parents to be loving committed to the task of raising their children with high expectations and a positive sense of selfregard They expected us to do morning and evening chores get to school on time get decent grades and be good people There are six children Six children It was never my idea that there should be so many of us but then no one consulted me To make matters worse fate dropped me off in the middle of the American heartland in a most harsh and cold climate Like all children I thought that there had been a great universal mistake and I had been placed in the wrong familymost definitely in the wrong state I disliked coping with the elements The winters in Iowa are so freezing cold that you have to make rounds in the middle of the night to see that livestock arent stranded in a place where they would freeze to death Newborn animals had to be taken in the barn and sometimes warmed up in order to be kept alive Winters are that cold in Iowa My dad an incredibly handsome strong charismatic and energetic man was always in motion My brothers and sisters and I were in awe of him We honored him and held him in the highest esteem Now I understand why There were no inconsistencies in his life He was an honorable man highly principled Farming his chosen work was his passion he was the best He was at home raising and caring for animals He felt at one with the earth and took great pride in planting and harvesting the crops He refused to hunt out of season even though deer pheasants quail and other game roamed our farmlands in abundance He refused to use soil additives or feed the animals anything other than natural grains He taught us why he did this and why we must embrace the same ideals Today I can see how conscientious he was because this was in the mid1950s before there was an attempt at universal commitment to earthwide environmental preservation Dad was also a very impatient man but not in the middle of the night when he was checking his animals during these late night rounds The relationship we developed from these times together was simply unforgettable It made a compelling difference in my life I learned so  much about him I often hear men and women say they spent so little time with their fathers Indeed the heart of todays mens groups is about groping for a father they never really knew I knew mine Back then I felt as if I was secretly his favorite child although its quite possible that each of us six children felt that way Now that was both good news and bad The bad news was that I was the one selected by Dad to go with him for these midnight and early morning barnyard checks and I absolutely detested getting up and leaving a warm bed to go out into the frosty air But my dad was at his best and most lovable during those times He was most understanding patient gentle and was a good listener His voice was gentle and his smile made me understand my mothers passion for him It was during these times when he was a model teacheralways focusing on the whys the reasons for doing He talked endlessly for the hour or hourandahalf that it took to make the rounds He talked about his war experiences the whys of the war he served in and about the region its people the effects of war and its aftermath Again and again he told his story In school I found history all the more exciting and familiar He talked about what he gained from his travels and why seeing the world was so important He instilled a need and love of traveling I had worked in or visited some 30 countries by the time I was 30 years old He talked about the need and love of learning and why a formal education is important and he talked about the difference between intelligence and wisdom He wanted so much for me to go beyond my high school degree You can do it hed say over and over Youre a Burres You are bright you have a good mind and remember youre a Burres There was no way I was going to let him down I had more than enough confidence to tackle any course of study Eventually I completed a PhD and later earned a second doctorate Though the first doctorate was for Dad and the second for me there was definitely a sense of curiosity and quest that made both easy to attain He talked about standards and values developing character and what it meant in the course of ones life I write and teach on a similar theme He talked about how to make and evaluate decisions when to cut your losses and walk away and when to stick it out even in the face of adversity He talked about the concept of being and becoming and not just having and getting I still use that phrase Never sell out on your heart he said He talked about gut instincts and how to decipher  between those and emotional sells and how to avoid being fooled by others He said Always listen to your instincts and know that all the answers youll ever need are within you Take quiet time alone Be still enough to find the answers within and then listen to them Find something you love to do then live a life that shows it Your goals should stem from your values and then your work will radiate your hearts desire This will divert you from all silly distractions that will only serve to waste your timeyour very life is about timehow much you can grow in whatever years you are given Care about people he said and always respect mother earth Wherever you shall live be sure you have full view of the trees sky and land My father When I reflect on how he loved and valued his children Im genuinely sorry for the youth who will never know their fathers in this way or will never feel the power of character ethics drive and sensitivity all in one personas I do in mine My dad modeled what he talked And I always knew he was serious about me I knew he felt me worthy and he wanted me to see that worth Dads message made sense to me because I never saw any conflict in the way he lived his life He had thought about his life and he lived it daily He bought and paid for several farms over time hes as active today as he was then He married and has loved the same woman for a lifetime My mother and he now married for nearly 50 years are still inseparable sweethearts They are the greatest lovers Ive known And he loved his family so much I thought he was overly possessive and protective of his children but now that Im a parent I can understand those needs and see them for what they are Though he thought he could save us from the measles and almost did he vehemently refused to lose us to destructive vices I also see how determined he was that we be caring and responsible adults To this day five of his children live within a few miles of him and they have chosen a version of his lifestyle They are devoted spouses and parents and agriculture is their chosen work They are without a doubt the backbone of their community There is a twist to all this and I suspect its because of his taking me on those midnight rounds I took a different direction than did the other five children I began a career as an educator counselor and university professor eventually writing several books for parents and children to share what I had learned about the importance of developing selfesteem in the childhood years My messages to my daughter while altered a bit are the values that I  learned from my father tempered with my life experiences of course They continue to be passed on I should tell you a bit about my daughter Shes a tomboy a beautiful 5 foot 9 athlete who letters in three sports each year frets over the difference between an Aand a B and was just named a finalist in the Miss Teen California contest But its not her outward gifts and accomplishments that remind me of my parents People always tell me that my daughter possesses a great kindness a spirituality a special fire deep inside that radiates outward The essence of my parents is personified in their granddaughter The rewards of esteeming their children and being dedicated parents have had a most nourishing effect on the lives of my parents as well As of this writing my father is at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester Minnesota for a battery of tests scheduled to take from six to eight days It is December Because of the harsh winter he took a hotel room near the clinic as an outpatient Because of obligations at home my mother was only able to stay with him for the first few days So on Christmas Eve they were apart That night I first called my dad in Rochester to say Merry Christmas He sounded down and despondent Then I called my mother in Iowa She was sad and morose This is the first time your father and I have ever spent the holidays apart she lamented Its just not Christmas without him I had 14 dinner guests arriving all ready for a festive evening I returned to cooking but not being able to get my parents dilemma fully off my mind I called my older sister She called my brothers We conferenced by phone It was settled Determined that our parents should not be without each other on Christmas Eve my younger brother would drive the two hours to Rochester to pick up my father and bring him home without telling my mother I called my father to tell him of the plans Oh no he said its far too dangerous to come out on a night like this My brother arrived in Rochester and knocked at my fathers hotel door He called me from Dads room to tell me he wouldnt go You have to tell him Bobbie Youre the only one hell listen to Go Dad I said gently He did Tim and my dad started for Iowa We kids kept track of their progress the journey and the weather by talking with them on my brothers car phone By now all my guests had arrived and all were a part of this ordeal Whenever the phone rang we put it on the speaker  phone so we could hear the latest It was just past 900 when the phone rang and it was Dad on the car phone Bobbie how can I possibly go home without a gift for your mom It would be the first time in nearly 50 years I didnt get her perfume for Christmas By now my entire dinner party was engineering this plan We called my sister to get the names of nearby open shopping centers so they could stop for the only gift my dad would consider giving Momthe same brand of perfume he has given her every year at Christmas At 952 that evening my brother and my dad left a little shopping mall in Minnesota for the trip home At 1150 they drove into the farmstead My father acting like a giggling school boy stepped around the corner of the house and stood out of sight Mom I visited Dad today and he said to bring you his laundry my brother said as he handed my mom the suitcases Oh she said softly and sadly I miss him so much I might as well do these now Said my father coming out from his hiding You wont have time to do them tonight After my brother called me to relay this touching scene between our parentsthese two friends and loversI phoned my mother Merry Christmas Mother Oh you kids she said in a crackling voice choking back tears She was unable to continue My guests cheered Though I was 2000 miles away from them it was one of the most special Christmases Ive shared with my parents And of course to date my parents have not been apart on Christmas Eve Thats the strength of children who love and honor their parents and of course the committed and marvelous marriage my parents share Good parents Jonas Salk once told me give their children roots and wings Roots to know where home is wings to fly away and exercise whats been taught them If gaining the skills to lead ones life purposefully and having a safe nest and being welcomed back to it is the legacy of parents then I believe I chose my parents well It was this past Christmas that I most fully understood why it was necessary that these two people be my parents Though wings have taken me around the globe eventually to nest in lovely California the roots my parents gave me will be an indelible foundation forever Bettie B Youngs  The Animal School Once upon a time the animals decided they must do something heroic to meet the problems of a new world So they organized a school They adopted an activity curriculum consisting of running climbing swimming and flying To make it easier to administer the curriculum all the animals took all the subjects The duck was excellent in swimming in fact better than his instructor but he made only passing grades in flying and was very poor in running Since he was slow in running he had to stay after school and also drop swimming in order to practice running This was kept up until his webbed feet were badly worn and he was only average in swimming But average was acceptable in school so nobody worried about that except the duck The rabbit started at the top of the class in running but had a nervous breakdown because of so much makeup work in swimming The squirrel was excellent in climbing until he developed frustration in the flying class where his teacher made him start from the ground up instead of from the treetop down He also developed a charlie horse from overexertion and then got a C in climbing and a D in running The eagle was a problem child and was disciplined severely In the climbing class he beat all the others to the top of the tree but insisted on using his own way to get there At the end of the year an abnormal eel that could swim exceedingly well and also run climb and fly a little had the highest average and was valedictorian The prairie dogs stayed out of school and fought the tax levy because the administration would not add digging and burrowing to the curriculum They apprenticed their children to a badger and later joined the groundhogs and gophers to start a successful private school Does this fable have a moral George H Reavis  Touched She is my daughter and is immersed in the turbulence of her 16th year Following a recent bout with illness she learned her best friend would soon be moving away School was not going as well as she had hoped nor as well as her mother and I had hoped She exuded sadness through a muffle of blankets as she huddled in bed searching for comfort I wanted to reach out to her and wrench away all the miseries that had taken root in her young spirit Yet even aware of how much I cared for her and wanted to remove her unhappiness I knew the importance of proceeding with caution As a family therapist Ive been welleducated about inappropriate expressions of intimacy between fathers and daughters primarily by clients whose lives have been torn apart by sexual abuse Im also aware of how easily care and closeness can be sexualized especially by men who find the emotional field foreign territory and who mistake any expression of affection for sexual invitation How much easier it was to hold and comfort her when she was two or three or even seven But now her body our society and my manhood all seemed to conspire against my comforting my daughter How could I console her while still respecting the necessary boundaries between a father and a teenage daughter I settled for offering her a back rub She consented I gently massaged her bony back and knotted shoulders as I apologized for my recent absence I explained that I had just returned from the international backrubbing finals where I had placed fourth I assured her that its hard to beat the back rub of a concerned father especially if hes a world class back rubbing concerned father I told her all about the contest and the other contestants as my hands and fingers sought to loosen tightened muscles and unlock the tensions in her young life I told her about the shrunken antique Asian man who had placed third in the contest After studying acupuncture and acupressure his entire life he could focus all his energy into his fingers elevating back rubbing to an art He poked and prodded with prestidigitatious precision I explained showing my daughter a sample of what Id learned from the old man She groaned though I wasnt sure whether in response to my alliteration or my touch Then I told her about the woman who had placed second She was from Turkey and since her childhood had practiced the art of belly dancing so she could make muscles move and  ripple in fluid motion With her back rub her fingers awakened in tired muscles and weary bodies an urge to vibrate and quiver and dance She let her fingers do the walking and the muscles tagged along I said demonstrating Thats weird emanated faintly from a face muffled by a pillow Was it my oneliner or my touch Then I just rubbed my daughters back and we settled into silence After a time she asked So who got first place Youd never believe it I said It was baby And I explained how the soft trusting touches of an infant exploring a world of skin and smells and tastes was like no other touch in the world Softer than soft Unpredictable gentle searching Tiny hands saying more than words could ever express About belonging About trust About innocent love And then I gently and softly touched her as I had learned from the infant I recalled vividly her own infancyholding her rocking her watching her grope and grow into her world I realized that she in fact was the infant who had taught me about the touch of the infant After another period of gentle back rubbing and silence I said I was glad to have learned so much from the worlds expert back rubbers I explained how I had become an even better back rubber for a 16yearold daughter painfully stretching herself into adult shape I offered a silent prayer of thanks that such life had been placed in my hands and that I was blessed with the miracle of touching even a part of it Victor Nelson  I Love You Son Thoughts while driving my son to school Morning Kid You look pretty sharp in your Cub Scout gear not as fat as your old man when he was a Cub I dont think my hair was ever as long until I went away to college but I think Id recognize you

selling people short Youve got to learn what you are able to do and what you arentand youve got to learn how to deal with that Youve got to learn about people and how they behave when they dont feel good about themselveslike the bullies who hang out at the bike rack and hassle the smaller kids Yeah youll even have to learn how to pretend that namecalling doesnt hurt Itll always hurt but youll have to put up a front or theyll call you worse names next time I only hope you remember how it feelsin case you ever decide to rank a kid whos smaller than you When was the last time I told you I was proud of you I guess if I cant remember Ive got work to do I remember the last time I yelled at youtold you wed be late if you didnt hurrybut on balance as Nixon used to say I havent given you as many pats as yells For the record in case you read this I am proud of you I especially like your independence the way you take care of yourself even when it frightens me just a little bit Youve never been

punching you on the arm and saying Whaddaya say kid instead of hugging you and telling you I love you Life is too short to hide affection Why is it that eightyearolds are so slow to realize that 36yearolds need as many hugs as fouryearolds  Did I forget to tell you that Im proud you went back to a box lunch after one weeks worth of that indigestible hot lunch Im glad you value your body I wish the drive werent so short I want to talk about last night when your younger brother was asleep and we let you stay up and watch the Yankees game Those times are so special Theres no way you can

How are you doing in school son Id already checked your math homework the only way I couldwith a calculator Youre better with numbers than Ill ever be So we talked about the game and you knew more about the players than I did and I learned from you And we were both happy when the Yankees won Well theres the crossing guard Hell probably outlive all of us I wish you didnt have to go to school today There are so many things I want to say Your exit from my car is so quick I want to savor the moment and youve already spotted a couple of your friends I just wanted to say I love you son Victor B Miller  What You Are Is As Important As What You Do Who you are speaks so loudly I cant hear what youre saying Ralph Waldo Emerson It was a sunny Saturday afternoon in Oklahoma City My friend and proud father Bobby Lewis was taking his two little boys to play miniature golf He walked up to the fellow at the ticket counter and said How much is it to get in The young man replied 300 for you and 300 for any kid who is older than six We let them in free if they are six or younger How old are they Bobby replied The lawyers three and the doctor is seven so I guess I owe you 600 The man at the ticket counter said Hey Mister did you just win the lottery or something You could have saved yourself three bucks You could have told me that the older one was six I wouldnt have known the difference Bobby replied Yes that may be true but the kids would have known the difference As Ralph Waldo Emerson said Who you are speaks so loudly I cant hear what youre saying In challenging times when ethics

Delia Ephron  The Perfect American Family It is 1030 on a perfect Saturday morning and we are for the moment the perfect American family My wife has taken our sixyearold to his first piano lesson Our 14yearold has not yet roused from his slumber The fouryearold watches tiny anthropomorphic beings hurl one another from cliffs in the other room I sit at the kitchen table reading the newspaper Aaron Malachi the fouryearold apparently bored by the cartoon carnage and the considerable personal power obtained by holding the televisions remote control enters my space Im hungry he says Want some more cereal No Want some yogurt No Want some eggs No Can I have some ice cream No For all I know ice cream may be far more nourishing than processed cereal or antibioticladen eggs but according to my cultural values it is wrong to have ice cream at 1045 on a Saturday morning Silence About four seconds Daddy we have very much of life left dont we Yes we have lots of life left Aaron Me and you and Mommy Thats right And Isaac Yes And Ben Yes You and me and Mommy and Isaac and Ben We have very much of life left Until all the people die What do you mean Until all the people die and the dinosaurs come back Aaron sits down on the table crosslegged like a Buddha in the center of my newspaper What do you mean Aaron until all the people die  You said everybody dies When everybody dies then the dinosaurs will come back The cavemen lived in caves dinosaur caves Then the dinosaurs came back and squished em I realize that already for Aaron life is a limited economy a resource with a beginning and an end He envisions himself and us somewhere along that trajectory a trajectory that ends in uncertainty and loss I am faced with an ethical decision What should I do now Should I attempt to give him God salvation eternity Should I toss him some spiel like Your body is just a shell and after you die we will all be together in spirit forever Or should I leave him with his uncertainty and his anxiety because I think its real Should I try to make him an anxious existentialist or should I try to make him feel better I dont know I stare at the newspaper The Celtics are consistently losing on Friday nights Larry Bird is angry at somebody but I cans see who because Aarons foot is in the way I dont know but my neurotic addictive middleclass sensibility is telling me that this is a very important moment a moment when Aarons ways of constructing his world are being formed Or maybe my neurotic addictive middleclass sensibility is just making me think that If life and death are an illusion then why should I trifle with how someone else understands them On the table Aaron plays with an army guy raising his arms and balancing him on his shaky legs It was Kevin McHale that Larry Bird was angry at No not Kevin McHale it was Jerry Sichting But Jerry Sichting is no longer with the Celtics Whatever happened to Jerry Sichting Everything dies everything comes to an end Jerry Sichting is playing for Sacramento or Orlando or he has disappeared I should not trifle with how Aaron understands life and death because I want him to have a solid sense of structure a sense of the permanence of things Its obvious what a good job the nuns and priests did with me It was agony or bliss Heaven and hell were not connected by long distance service You were on Gods team or you were in the soup and the soup was hot I dont want Aaron to get burned but I want him to have a strong frame The neurotic but unavoidable anxiety can come later Is that possible It is possible to have a sense that God spirit karma YHWH somethingis transcendent without traumatizing the presentness of a person without beating it into them Can we have our  cake and eat it too ontologically speaking Or is their fragile sensibility their thereness sundered by such an act Sensing a slight increase in agitation on the table I know that Aaron is becoming bored with his guy With an attitude of drama benefiting the moment I clear my throat and begin with a professional tone Aaron death is something that some people believe  Dad Aaron interrupts could we play a video game Its not a very violent game he explains hands gesticulating Its not like a killing game The guys just kind of flop over Yes I say with some relief lets play video games But first theres something else we have to do What Aaron stops and turns from where he has run already halfway to the arcade First lets have some ice cream Another perfect Saturday for a perfect family For now Michael Murphy  Just Say It If you were going to die soon and had only one phone call you could make who would you call and what would you say And why are you waiting Stephen Levine One night after reading one of the hundreds of parenting books Ive read I was feeling a little guilty because the book had described some parenting strategies I hadnt used in a while The main strategy was to talk with your child and use those three magic words I love you It had stressed over and over that children need to know that unconditionally and unequivocally that you really love them I went upstairs to my sons bedroom and knocked on the door As I knocked all I could hear were his drums I knew he was there but he wasnt answering So I opened the door and sure enough there he was sitting with his earphones on listening to a tape and playing his drums After I leaned over to get his attention I said to him Tim have you got a second He said Oh sure Dad Im always good for one We proceeded to sit down and after about 15 minutes and a lot of small talk and stuttering I just looked at him and said Tim I really love the way you play drums He said Oh thanks Dad I appreciate it I walked out of the door and said See you later As I was walking downstairs it dawned on me that I went up there with a certain message and had not delivered it I felt it was really important to get back up there and have another chance to say those three magic words Again I climbed the stairs knocked on the door and opened it You got a second Tim Sure Dad Im always good for a second or two What do you need Son the first time I came up here to share a message with you something else came out It really wasnt what I wanted to share with you Tim do you remember when you were learning how to drive it caused me a lot of problems I wrote three words and slipped them under your pillow in hopes that would take care of it Id done my part as a parent and expressed my love to my son Finally after a little small  talk I looked at Tim and said What I want you to know is that we love you He looked at me and said Oh thanks Dad Thats you and Mom I said Yeah thats both of us we just dont express it enough He said Thanks that means a lot I know you do I turned around and walked out the door As I was walking downstairs I started thinking I cant believe this Ive already been up there twiceI know what the message is and yet something else comes out of my mouth I decided Im going back there now and let Tim know exactly how I feel Hes going to hear it directly from me I dont care if he is six feet tall So back I go knock on the door and he yells Wait a minute Dont tell me who it is Could that be you Dad I said Howd you know that and he responded Ive known you ever since you were a parent Dad Then I said Son have you got just one more second You know Im good for one so come on in I suppose you didnt tell me what you wanted to tell me I said Howd you know that Ive known you ever since I was in diapers I said Well here it is Tim what Ive been holding back on I just want to express to you how special you are to our family Its not what you do and its not what youve done like all the things youre doing with the junior high kids in town Its who you are as a person I love you and I just wanted you to know I love you and I dont know why I hold back on something so important He looked at me and he said Hey Dad I know you do and its really special hearing you say it to me Thanks so much for your thoughts as well as the intent As I was walking out the door he said Oh hey Dad Have you got another second I started thinking Oh no Whats he going to say to me I said Oh sure Im always good for one I dont know where kids get thisIm sure it couldnt be from their parents but he said Dad I just want to ask you one question I said Whats that He looked at me and said Dad have you been to a workshop or something like that  Im thinking Oh no like any other 18yearold hes got my number and I said No I was reading a book and it said how important it is to tell your kids how you really feel about them Hey thanks for taking the time Talk to you later Dad I think what Tim taught me more than anything else that night is that the only way you can understand the real meaning and purpose of love is to be willing to pay the price You have to go out there and risk sharing it Gene Bedley  A Legacy Of Love As a young man Al was a skilled artist a potter He had a wife and two fine sons One night his oldest son developed a severe stomachache Thinking it was only some common intestinal disorder neither Al nor his wife took the condition very seriously But the malady was actually acute appendicitis and the boy died suddenly that night Knowing the death could have been prevented if he had only realized the seriousness of the situation Als emotional health deteriorated under the enormous burden of his guilt To make matters worse his wife left him a short time later leaving him alone with his sixyearold younger son The hurt and pain of the two situations were more than Al could handle and he turned to alcohol to help him cope In time Al became an alcoholic As the alcoholism progressed Al began to lose everything he possessedhis home his land his art objects everything Eventually Al died alone in a San Francisco motel room When I heard of Als death I reacted with the same disdain the world shows for one who ends his life with nothing material to show for it What a complete failure I thought What a totally wasted life As time went by I began to reevaluate my earlier harsh judgment You see I knew Als now adult son Ernie He is one of the kindest most caring most loving men I have ever known I watched Ernie with his children and saw the free flow of love between them I knew that kindness and caring had to come from somewhere I hadnt heard Ernie talk much about his father It is so hard to defend an alcoholic One day I worked up my courage to ask him Im really puzzled by something I said I know your father was basically the only one to raise you What on earth did he do that you became such a special person Ernie sat quietly and reflected for a few moments Then he said From my earliest memories as a child until I left home at 18 Al came into my room every night gave me a kiss and said I love you son Tears came to my eyes as I realized what a fool I had been to judge Al as a failure He had not left any material possessions behind But he had been a kind loving father and he left behind one of the finest most giving men I have ever known Bobbie Gee Winning The Image Game  On Parenting Your children are not your children They are the sons and daughters of Lifes longing for itself They come through you but not from you And though they are with you yet they belong not to you You may give them your love but not your thoughts For they have their own thoughts You may house their bodies but not their souls For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow which you cannot visit not even in your dreams You may strive to be like them but seek not to make them like you For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite and He bends you with His might that His arrows might go swift and far Let your bending in the archers hand be for gladness For even as He loves the arrow that flies so He loves also the bow that is stable Kahlil Gibran  ON LEARNING Learning is finding out what you already know Doing is demonstrating that you know it Teaching is reminding others that they know it just as well as you You are all learners doers teachers Richard Bach I Like Myself Now Once you see a childs selfimage begin to improve you will see significant gains in achievement areas but even more important you will see a child who is beginning to enjoy life more Wayne Dyer I had a great feeling of relief when I began to understand that a youngster needs more than just subject matter I know mathematics well and I teach it well I used to think that was all I needed to do Now I teach children not math I accept the fact that I can only succeed partially with some of them When I dont have to know all the answers I seem to have more answers than when I tried to be the expert The youngster who really made me understand this was Eddie I asked him one day why he thought he was doing so much better than last year He gave meaning to my whole new orientation Its because I like myself now when Im with you he said A teacher quoted by Everett Shostrom in Man The Manipulator  All The Good Things He was in the third grade class I taught at Saint Marys School in Morris Minnesota All 34 of my students were dear to me but Mark Eklund was one in a million Very neat in appearance he had that happytobealive attitude that made even his occasional mischievousness delightful Mark also talked incessantly I tried to remind him again and again that talking without permission was not acceptable What impressed me so much though was the sincere response every time I had to correct him for misbehaving Thank you for correcting me Sister I didnt know what to make of it at first but before long I became accustomed to hearing it many times a day One morning my patience was growing thin when Mark talked once too often I made a noviceteachers mistake I looked at Mark and said If you say one more word I am going to tape your mouth shut It wasnt ten seconds later when Chuck blurted out Mark is talking again I hadnt asked any of the students to help me watch Mark but since I had stated the punishment in front of the class I had to act on it I remember the scene as if it had occurred this morning I walked to my desk very deliberately opened the drawer and took out a roll of masking tape Without saying a word I proceeded to Marks desk tore off two pieces of tape and made a big X with them over his mouth I then returned to the front of the room As I glanced at Mark to see how he was doing he winked at me That did it I started laughing The entire class cheered as I walked back to Marks desk removed the tape and shrugged my shoulders His first words were Thank you for correcting me Sister At the end of the year I was asked to teach junior high math The years flew by and before I knew it Mark was in my classroom again He was more handsome than ever and just as polite Since he had to listen carefully to my instruction in the new math he did not talk as much in ninth grade One Friday things just didnt feel right We had worked hard on a new concept all week and I sensed that the students were growing frustrated with themselvesand edgy with one another I had to stop this crankiness before it got out of hand So I asked them to list the names of the other students in the room on two sheets of paper leaving a space  between each name Then I told them to think of the nicest thing they could say about each of their classmates and write it down It took the remainder of the class period to finish the assignment but as the students left the room each one handed me their paper Chuck smiled Mark said Thank you for teaching me Sister Have a good weekend That Saturday I wrote down the name of each student on a separate sheet of paper and I listed what everyone else had said about that individual On Monday I gave each student his or her list Some of them ran two pages Before long the entire class was smiling Really I heard whispered I never knew that meant anything to anyone I didnt know others liked me so much No one ever mentioned those papers in class again I never knew if they discussed them after class or with their parents but it didnt matter The exercise had accomplished its purpose The students were happy with themselves and one another again That group of students moved on Several years later after I had returned from a vacation my parents met me at the airport As we were driving home Mother asked the usual questions about the trip How the weather was my experiences in general There was a slight lull in the conversation Mother gave Dad a sideways glance and simply said Dad My father cleared his throat The Eklunds called last night he began Really I said I havent heard from them for several years I wonder how Mark is Dad responded quietly Mark was killed in Vietnam he said The funeral is tomorrow and his parents would like it if you could attend To this day I can still point to the exact spot on 1494 where Dad told me about Mark I had never seen a serviceman in a military coffin before Mark looked so handsome so mature All I could think at that moment was Mark I would give all the masking tape in the world if only you could talk to me The church was packed with Marks friends Chucks sister sang The Battle Hymn of the Republic Why did it have to rain on the day of the funeral It was difficult enough at the graveside The pastor said the usual prayers and the bugler played taps One by one those who loved Mark took a last walk by the coffin and sprinkled it with holy water  I was the last one to bless the coffin As I stood there one of the soldiers who had acted as a pallbearer came up to me Were you Marks math teacher he asked I nodded as I continued to stare at the coffin Mark talked about you a lot he said After the funeral most of Marks former classmates headed to Chucks farmhouse for lunch Marks mother and father were there obviously waiting for me We want to show you something his father said taking a wallet out of his pocket They found this on Mark when he was killed We thought you might recognize it Opening the billfold he carefully removed two worn pieces of notebook paper that had obviously been taped folded and refolded many times I knew without looking that the papers were the ones on which I had listed all the good things each of Marks classmates had said about him Thank you so much for doing that Marks mother said As you can see Mark treasured it Marks classmates started to gather around us Chuck smiled rather sheepishly and said I still have my list Its in the top drawer of my desk at home Johns wife said John asked me to put his in our wedding album I have mine too Marilyn said Its in my diary Then Vicki another classmate reached into her pocketbook took out her wallet and showed her worn and frazzled list to the group I carry this with me at all times Vicki said without batting an eyelash I think we all saved our lists Thats when I finally sat down and cried I cried for Mark and for all his friends who would never see him again Helen P Mrosla  You Are A Marvel Each second we live is a new and unique moment of the universe a moment that will never be again And what do we teach our children We teach them that two and two make four and that Paris is the capital of France When will we also teach them what they are We should say to each of them Do you know what you are You are a marvel You are unique In all the years that have passed there has never been another child like you Your legs your arms your clever fingers the way you move You may become a Shakespeare a Michelangelo a Beethoven You have the capacity for anything Yes you are a marvel And when you grow up can you then have another who is like you a marvel You must workwe must all workto make the world worthy of its children Pablo Casals  All I Ever Really Needed To Know I Learned In Kindergarten Most of what I really need to know about how to live and what to do and how to be I learned in kindergarten Wisdom was not at the top of the graduate mountain but there in the sandbox at nursery school These are the things I learned Share everything Play fair Dont hit people Put things back where you found them Clean up your own mess Dont take things that arent yours Say youre sorry when you hurt somebody Wash your hands before you eat Flush Warm cookies and cold milk are good for you Live a balanced life Learn some and think some and draw and paint and sing and dance and play and work every day some Take a nap every afternoon When you go out into the world watch for traffic hold hands and stick together Be aware of wonder Remember the little seed in the plastic cup The roots go down and the plant goes up and nobody really knows how or why but we are all like that Goldfish and hamsters and white mice and even the little seed in the plastic cupthey all die So do we And then remember the book about Dick and Jane and the first word you learned the biggest word of all LOOK Everything you need to know is in there somewhere The Golden Rule and love and basic sanitation Ecology and politics and sane living Think of what a better world it would be if we allthe whole world had cookies and milk about 3 oclock every afternoon and then lay down with our blankets for a nap Or if we had a basic policy in our nations to always put things back where we found them and clean up our own messes And it is still true no matter how old you are when you go out into the world it is better to hold hands and stick together Robert Fulghum  We Learn By Doing Not many years ago I began to play the cello Most people would say that what I am doing is learning to play the cello But these words carry into our minds the strange idea that there exists two very different processes 1 learning to play the cello and 2 playing the cello They imply that I will do the first until I have completed it at which point I will stop the first process and begin the second In short I will go on learning to play until I have learned to play and then I will begin to play Of course this is nonsense There are not two processes but one We learn to do something by doing it There is no other way John Holt The Hand A Thanksgiving Day editorial in the newspaper told of a school teacher who asked her class of first graders to draw a picture of something they were thankful for She thought of how little these children from poor neighborhoods actually had to be thankful for But she knew that most of them would draw pictures of turkeys or tables with food The teacher was taken aback with the picture Douglas handed in a simple childishly drawn hand But whose hand The class was captivated by the abstract image I think it must be the hand of God that brings us food said one child A farmer said another because he grows the turkeys Finally when the others were at work the teacher bent over Douglass desk and asked whose hand it was Its your hand Teacher he mumbled She recalled that frequently at recess she had taken Douglas a scrubby forlorn child by the hand She often did that with the children But it meant so much to Douglas Perhaps this was everyones Thanksgiving not for the material things given to us but for the chance in whatever small way to give to others Source Unknown  The Royal Knights Of Harlem Within walking distance of my Manhattan apartment but also lightyears away there is a part of New York called Spanish Harlem In many ways it is a Third World country Infant and maternal mortality rates are about the same as in say Bangladesh and average male life expectancy is even shorter These facts it shares with the rest of Harlem yet here many people are also separated from the more affluent parts of the city by language When all this is combined with invisibility in the media the condescension of many teachers and police who work in this Third World country but wouldnt dream of living there and textbooks that have little to do with their lives the lesson for kids is clear They are less than people who live only a few blocks away At a junior high that rises from a barren patch of concrete playgrounds and metal fences on East 101st Street Bill Hall teaches the usual English courses plus English as a second language to students who arrive directly from Puerto Rico Central and South America even Pakistan and Hong Kong Those kids are faced with a new culture strange rules a tough neighborhood and parents who may be feeling just as lost as they are Bill Hall is faced with them While looking for an interest to bind one such group together and help them to learn English at the same time Bill noticed someone in the neighborhood carrying a chessboard As a chess player himself he knew this game crossed many cultural boundaries so he got permission from a very skeptical principal to start a chess club after school Few of the girls came Never having seen women playing chess they assumed this game wasnt for them and without even a female teacher as a role model those few who did come gradually dropped out Some of the boys stayed away toochess wasnt the kind of game that made you popular in this neighborhoodbut about a dozen remained to learn the basics Their friends made fun of them for staying after school and some parents felt that chess was a waste of time since it wouldnt help them get a job but still they kept coming Bill was giving these boys something rare in their lives the wholehearted attention of someone who believed in them Gradually their skills at both chess and English improved As they got more expert at the game Bill took them to chess matches in schools outside Spanish Harlem Because he paid for their subway fares and  pizza dinners no small thing on his teachers salary the boys knew he cared They began to trust this middleaged white man a little more To help them become more independent Bill asked each boy to captain one event and to handle all travel and preparation for it Gradually even when Bill wasnt around the boys began to assume responsibility for each other to coach those who were lagging behind to share personal problems and to explain to each others parents why chess wasnt such a waste of time after all Gradually too this new sense of competence carried over into their classrooms and their grades began to improve As they became better students and chess players Bill Halls dreams for them grew With a little money supplied by the Manhattan Chess Club he took them to the State Finals in Syracuse What had been twelve disparate isolated often passive shutdown kids had now become a team with their own chosen name The Royal Knights After finishing third in their own state they were eligible for the Junior High School Finals in California By now however even Bills own colleagues were giving him reasons why he shouldnt be spending so much time and effort In real life these ghetto kids would never get past New Jersey as one teacher put it Why raise funds to fly them across the country and make them more dissatisfied with their lives Nonetheless Bill raised money for tickets to California In that national competition they finished seventeenth out of 109 teams By now chess had become a subject of school interestif only because it led to trips On one of their days at a New York chess club the team members met a young girl from the Soviet Union who was the Womens World Champion Even Bill was floored by the idea that two of his kids came up with If this girl could come all the way from Russia why couldnt The Royal Knights go there After all it was the chess capital of the world and the Scholastic Chess Friendship Games were coming up Though no US players their age had ever entered these games officials in Bills school district rallied round the idea So did a couple of the corporations he approached for travel money Of course no one thought his team could win but that wasnt the goal The trip itself would widen the boys horizons Bill argued When PepsiCola came up with a 20000 check Bill began to realize that this crazy dream was going to come true  They boarded the plane for the first leg of their trip to Russia as official representatives of the country from which they had felt so estranged only a few months before But as veterans of Spanish Harlem they also made very clear that they were representing their own neighborhood On the back of their satin athletic jackets was emblazoned not USA but The Royal Knights Once they were in Moscow however their confidence began to falter badly The experience and deliberate style of their Soviet opponents were something they had never previously encountered Finally one of the Knights broke the spell by playing a Soviet Grand master in his 30s to a draw in a simulation match The Russians werent invincible after all just people like them After that the Knights won about half their matches and even discovered a homegrown advantage in the special event of speed chess Unlike the Soviet players who had been taught that slowness and deliberation were virtues the Knights had a streetsmart style that made them both fast and accurate By the time Bill and his team got to Leningrad to take on the toughest part of their competition the boys were feeling good again Though they had been selected at random for their need to learn English not for any talent at chess and though they had been playing for only a few months they won one match and achieved a draw in another When the Knights got back to New York they were convinced they could do anything It was a conviction they would need A few months later when I went to their junior high school club room Bill Hall a big gentle man who rarely gets angry was furious about a recent confrontation between one of the Puerto Rican team members and a white teacher As Bill urged the boy to explain to me he had done so well on a test that the teacher thinking he had cheated made him take it over When the boy did well a second time the teacher seemed less pleased than annoyed to have been proven wrong If this had been a school in a different neighborhood said Bill none of this would have happened It was the kind of classroom bias that these boys had been internalizingbut now had the selfesteem to resist Maybe the teacher was just jealous the boy said cheerfully I mean we put this school on the map And so they had Their dingy junior high auditorium had just been chosen by a Soviet dance troupe as the site of a New York performance Every principal in the school district was asking for a chess program  and local television and newspapers had interviewed The Royal Knights Now that their junior high graduation was just weeks away bids from various high schools with programs for gifted kids were flooding in even one from a high school in California Though all the boys were worried about their upcoming separation it was the other team members who persuaded the boy who got that invitation to accept it We told him to go for it as one said We promised to write him every week said another Actually said a third we all plan to stay in touch for life With career plans that included law accounting teaching computer sciencesfutures they wouldnt have thought possible beforethere was no telling what continuing surprises they might share at reunions of this team that had become its own support group and family What were they doing I asked before Bill Hall and chess playing came into their lives There was a very long silence Hanging out in the street and feeling like shit said one boy who now wants to become a lawyer Taking lunch money from younger kids and a few drugs now and then admitted another Just lying on my bed reading comics and getting yelled at by my father for being lazy said a third Was there anything in their schoolbooks that made a difference Not until Mr Hall thought we were smart explained one to the nods of the others and then we were Gloria Steinem  The Little Boy Once a little boy went to school He was quite a little boy And it was quite a big school But when the little boy Found that he could go to his room By walking right in from the door outside He was happy And the school did not seem Quite so big any more One morning When the little boy had been in school a while The teacher said Today we are going to make a picture Good thought the little boy He liked to make pictures He could make all kinds Lions and tigers Chickens and cows Trains and boats And he took out his box of crayons And began to draw But the teacher said Wait It is not time to begin And she waited until everyone looked ready Now said the teacher We are going to make flowers Good thought the little boy He liked to make flowers And he began to make beautiful ones With his pink and orange and blue crayons But the teacher said Wait And I will show you how And she drew a flower on the blackboard It was red with a green stem There said the teacher Now you may begin The little boy looked at the teachers flower  Then he looked at his own flower He liked his flower better than the teachers But he did not say this He just turned his paper over And made a flower like the teachers It was red with a green stem On another day When the little boy had opened The door from the outside all by himself The teacher said Today we are going to make something with clay Good thought the little boy He liked clay He could make all kinds of things with clay Snakes and snowmen Elephants and mice Cars and trucks And he began to pull and pinch His ball of clay But the teacher said Wait It is not time to begin And she waited until everyone looked ready Now said the teacher We are going to make a dish Good thought the little boy He liked to make dishes And he began to make some That were all shapes and sizes But the teacher said Wait And I will show you how And she showed everyone how to make One deep dish There said the teacher Now you may begin The little boy looked at the teachers dish Then he looked at his own He liked his dishes better than the teachers But he did not say this He just rolled his clay into a big ball again And made a dish like the teachers It was a deep dish And pretty soon The little boy learned to wait And to watch And to make things just like the teacher  And pretty soon He didnt make things of his own anymore Then it happened That the little boy and his family Moved to another house In another city And the little boy Had to go to another school This school was even Bigger Than the other one And there was no door from the outside Into his room He had to go up some big steps And walk down a long hall To get to his room And the very first day He was there the teacher said Today we are going to make a picture Good thought the little boy And he waited for the teacher To tell him what to do But the teacher didnt say anything She just walked around the room When she came to the little boy She said Dont you want to make a picture Yes said the little boy What are we going to make I dont know until you make it said the teacher How shall I make it asked the little boy Why any way you like said the teacher And any color asked the little boy Any color said the teacher If everyone made the same picture And used the same colors How would I know who made what And which was which I dont know said the little boy And he began to make pink and orange and blue flowers He liked his new school Even if it didnt have a

be done should not interrupt those who are doing it Source unknown  Make It Come True In 1957 a tenyearold boy in California set a goal At the time Jim Brown was the greatest running back ever to play pro football and this tall skinny boy wanted his autograph In order to accomplish his goal the young boy had to overcome some obstacles He grew up in the ghetto where he never got enough to eat Malnutrition took its toll and a disease called rickets forced him to wear steel splints to support his skinny bowedout legs He had no money to buy a ticket to get into the game so he waited patiently near the locker room until the game ended and Jim Brown left the field He politely asked Brown for his autograph As Brown signed the boy explained Mr Brown I have your picture on my wall I know you hold all the records Youre my idol Brown smiled and began to leave but the young boy wasnt finished He proclaimed Mr Brown one day Im going to break every record you hold Brown was impressed and asked What is your name son The boy replied Orenthal James My friends call me O J O J Simpson went on to break all but three of the rushing records held by Jim Brown before injuries shortened his football career Goal setting is the strongest force for human motivation Set a goal and make it come true Dan Clark  I Think I Can Whether you think you can or think you cant you re right Henry Ford Rocky Lyons the son of New York Jets defensive end Marty Lyons was five years old when he was driving through rural Alabama with his mother Kelly He was asleep on the front seat of their pickup truck with his feet resting on her lap As his mom drove carefully down the winding two lane country road she turned onto a narrow bridge As she did the truck hit a pothole and slid off the road and the right front wheel got stuck in a rut Fearing the truck would tip over she attempted to jerk it back up onto the road by pressing hard on the gas pedal and spinning the steering wheel to the left But Rockys foot got caught between her leg and the steering wheel and she lost control of the pickup truck The truck flipped over and over down a 20foot ravine When it hit bottom Rocky woke up What happened Mama he asked Our wheels are pointing toward the sky Kelly was blinded by blood The gearshift had jammed into her face ripping it open from lip to forehead Her gums were torn out her cheeks pulverized her shoulders crushed With one shattered bone sticking out of her armpit she was pinned against the crushed door Ill get you out Mama announced Rocky who had miraculously escaped injury He slithered out from under Kelly slid through the open window and tried to yank his mother out But she didnt move Just let me sleep begged Kelly who was drifting in and out of consciousness No Mama Rocky insisted You cant go to sleep Rocky wriggled back into the truck and managed to push Kelly out of the wreckage He then told her hed climb up to the road and stop a car to get help Fearing that no one would be able to see her little boy in the dark Kelly refused to let him go alone Instead they slowly crept up the embankment with Rocky using his meager 40pound frame to push his 104pound mother They crawled inches at a time The pain was so great that Kelly wanted to give up but Rocky wouldnt let her To urge his mother on Rocky told her to think about that little train the one in the classic childrens story The Little Engine That Could which managed to get up a steep mountain To remind her Rocky kept  repeating his version of the storys inspirational phrase I know you can I know you can When they finally reached the road Rocky was able to see his mothers torn face clearly for the first time He broke into tears Waving his arms and pleading Stop Please stop the boy hailed a truck Get my mama to a hospital he implored the driver It took 8 hours and 344 stitches to rebuild Kellys face She looks quite different todayI used to have a straight long nose thin lips and high cheekbones now Ive got a pug nose flat cheeks and much bigger lipsbut she has few visible scars and has recovered from her injuries Rockys heroics were big news But the spunky youngster insists he didnt do anything extraordinary Its not like I wanted it to happen he explains I just did what anyone would have done Says his mother If it werent for Rocky Id have bled to death First heard from Michele Borba  Rest In Peace The I Cant Funeral Donnas fourthgrade classroom looked like many others I had seen in the past Students sat in five rows of six desks The teachers desk was in the front and faced the students The bulletin board featured student work In most respects it appeared to be a typically traditional elementary classroom Yet something seemed different that day I entered it for the first time There seemed to be an undercurrent of excitement Donna was a veteran smalltown Michigan schoolteacher only two years away from retirement In addition she was a volunteer participant in a countywide staff development project I had organized and facilitated The training focused on language arts ideas that would empower students to feel good about themselves and take charge of their lives Donnas job was to attend training sessions and implement the concepts being presented My job was to make classroom visitations and encourage implementation I took an empty seat in the back of the room and watched All the students were working on a task filling a sheet of notebook paper with thoughts and ideas The tenyearold student closest to me was filling her page with I Cants I cant kick the soccer ball past second base I cant do long division with more than three numerals I cant get Debbie to like me Her page was half full and she showed no signs of letting up She worked on with determination and persistence I walked down the row glancing at students papers Everyone was writing sentences describing things they couldnt do I cant do ten pushups I cant hit one over the leftfield fence I cant eat only one cookie By this time the activity engaged my curiosity so I decided to check with the teacher to see what was going on As I approached her I noticed that she too was busy writing I felt it best not to interrupt I cant get Johns mother to come in for a teacher conference I cant get my daughter to put gas in the car I cant get Alan to use words instead of fists  Thwarted in my efforts to determine why students and teacher were dwelling on the negative instead of writing the more positive I Can statements I returned to my seat and continued my observations Students wrote for another ten minutes Most filled their page Some started another Finish the one youre on and dont start a new one were the instructions Donna used to signal the end of the activity Students were then instructed to fold their papers in half and bring them to the front When students reached the teachers desk they placed their I Cant statements into an empty shoe box When all of the student papers were collected Donna added hers She put the lid on the box tucked it under her arm and headed out the door and down the hall Students followed the teacher I followed the students Halfway down the hall the procession stopped Donna entered the custodians room rummaged around and came out with a shovel Shovel in one hand shoe box in the other Donna marched the students out of the school to the farthest corner of the playground There they began to dig They were going to bury their I Cants The digging took over ten minutes because most of the fourthgraders wanted a turn When the hole approached threefeet deep the digging ended The box of I Cants was placed in position at the bottom of the hole and quickly covered with dirt Thirtyone 10 and 11yearolds stood around the freshly dug grave site Each had at least one page full of I Cants in the shoe box fourfeet under So did their teacher At this point Donna announced Boys and girls please join hands and bow your heads The students complied They quickly formed a circle around the grave creating a bond with their hands They lowered their heads and waited Donna delivered the eulogy Friends we gather today to honor the memory of I Cant While he was with us on earth he touched the lives of everyone some more than others His name unfortunately has been spoken in every public buildingschools city halls state capitols and yes even The White House We have provided I Cant with a final resting place and a headstone that contains his epitaph He is survived by his brothers and sister  I Can I Will and Im Going to Right Away They are not as well known as their famous relative and are certainly not as strong and powerful yet Perhaps some day with your help they will make an even bigger mark on the world May 1 Cant rest in peace and may everyone present pick up their lives and move forward in his absence Amen As I listened to the eulogy I realized that these students would never forget this day The activity was symbolic a metaphor for life It was a rightbrain experience that would stick in the unconscious and conscious mind forever Writing I Cants burying them and hearing the eulogy That was a major effort on the part of this teacher And she wasnt done yet At the conclusion of the eulogy she turned the students around marched them back into the classroom and held a wake They celebrated the passing of I Cant with cookies popcorn and fruit juices As part of the celebration Donna cut out a large tombstone from butcher paper She wrote the words I Cant at the top and put RIP in the middle The date was added at the bottom The paper tombstone hung in Donnas classroom for the remainder of the year On those rare occasions when a student forgot and said I Cant Donna simply pointed to the RIP sign The student then remembered that I Cant was dead and chose to rephrase the statement I wasnt one of Donnas students She was one of mine Yet that day I learned an enduring lesson from her Now years later whenever I hear the phrase I Cant I see images of that fourthgrade funeral Like the students I remember that I Cant is dead Chick Moorman  The 333 Story I was doing a weekend seminar at the Deerhurst Lodge north of Toronto On Friday night a tornado swept through a town north of us called Barrie killing several people and doing millions of dollars worth of damage Sunday night as I was coming home I stopped the car when I got to Barrie I got out on the side of the highway and looked around It was a mess Everywhere I looked there were smashed houses and cars turned upside down That same night Bob Templeton was driving down the same highway He stopped to look at the disaster just as I had only his thoughts were different than my own Bob was the vice president of Telemedia Communications which owns a string of radio stations in Ontario and Quebec He thought there must be something we could do for these people with the radio stations they had The following night I was doing another seminar in Toronto Bob Templeton and Bob Johnson another vice president from Telemedia came in and stood in the back of the room They shared their conviction that there had to be something they could do for the people in Barrie After the seminar we went back to Bobs office He was now committed to the idea of helping the people who had been caught in the tornado The following Friday he called all the executives at Telemedia into his office At the top of a flip chart he wrote three 3s He said to his executives How would you like to raise 3 million dollars 3 days from now in just 3 hours and give the money to the people in Barrie There was nothing but silence in the room Finally someone said Templeton youre crazy There is no way we could do that Bob said Wait a minute I didnt ask you if we could or even if we should I just asked you if youd like to They all said Sure wed like to He then drew a large T underneath the 333 On one side he wrote Why we cant On the other side he wrote How we can Im going to put a big X on the Why we cant side Were not going to spend any time on the ideas of why we cant Thats of no value On the other side were going to write down every idea that we can come up with on how we can Were not going to leave the room until we figure it out There was silence again  Finally someone said We could do a radio show across Canada Bob said Thats a great idea and wrote it down Before he had it written someone said You cant do a radio show across Canada We dont have radio stations across Canada That was a pretty valid objection They only had stations in Ontario and Quebec Templeton replied Thats why we can That stays But this was a really strong objection because radio stations are very competitive They usually dont work together and to get them to do so would be virtually impossible according to the standard way of thinking All of a sudden someone suggested You could get Harvey Kirk and Lloyd Robertson the biggest names in Canadian broadcasting to anchor the show That would be like getting Tom Brokaw and Sam Donaldson to anchor the show They are anchors on national TV They are not going to go on radio At that point it was absolutely amazing how fast and furious the creative ideas began to flow That was on a Friday The following Tuesday they had a radiothon They had 50 radio stations all across the country that agreed to broadcast it It didnt matter who got the credit as long as the people in Barrie got the money Harvey Kirk and Lloyd Robertson anchored the show and they succeeded in raising 3 million dollars in 3 hours within 3 business days You see you can do anything if you put your focus on how to do it rather than on why you cant Bob Proctor  There Are No Vans I remember one Thanksgiving when our family had no money and no food and someone came knocking on our door A man was standing there with a huge box of food a giant turkey and even some pans to cook it in I couldnt believe it My dad demanded Who are you Where are you from The stranger announced Im here because a friend of yours knows youre in need and that you wouldnt accept direct help so Ive brought this for you Have a great Thanksgiving My father said No no we cant accept this The stranger replied You dont have a choice closed the door and left Obviously that experience had a profound impact on my life I promised myself that someday I would do well enough financially so that I could do the same thing for other people By the time I was 18 I had created my Thanksgiving ritual I like to do things spontaneously so I would go out shopping and buy enough food for one or two families Then I would dress like a delivery boy go to the poorest neighborhood and just knock on a door I always included a note that explained my Thanksgiving experience as a kid The note concluded All that I ask in return is that you take good enough care of yourself so that someday you can do the same thing for someone else I have received more from this annual ritual than I have from any amount of money Ive ever earned Several years ago I was in New York City with my new wife during Thanksgiving She was sad because we were not with our family Normally she would be home decorating the house for Christmas but we were stuck here in a hotel room I said Honey look why dont we decorate some lives today instead of some old trees When I told her what I always do on Thanksgiving she got excited I said Lets go someplace where we can really appreciate who we are what we are capable of and what we can really give Lets go to Harlem She and several of my business partners who were with us werent really enthusiastic about the idea I urged them Cmon lets go to Harlem and feed some people in need We wont be the people who are giving it because that would be insulting Well just be the delivery people Well go buy enough food for six or seven families for 30 days Weve got enough Lets just go do it Thats what Thanksgiving really is Giving good thanks not eating turkey Cmon Lets go do it Because I had to do a radio interview first I asked my partners to get us started by getting a van When I returned from the interview they said We just cant do it There are no vans in all of New York The rentacar places are all out of vans Theyre just not available I said Look the bottom line is that if we want something we can make it happen All we have to do is take action There are plenty of vans here in New York City We just dont have one Lets go get one They insisted Weve called everywhere There arent any I said Look down at the street Look down there Do you see all those vans They said Yeah we see them Lets go get one I said First I tried walking out in front of vans as they were driving down the street I learned something about New York drivers that day They dont stop they speed up Then we tried waiting by the light Wed go over and knock on the window and the driver would roll it down looking at us kind of leery and Id say Hi Since today is Thanksgiving wed like to know if you would be willing to drive us to Harlem so we can feed some people Every time the driver would look away quickly furiously roll up the window and pull away without saying anything Eventually we got better at asking Wed knock on the window theyd roll it down and wed say Today is Thanksgiving Wed like to help some underprivileged people and were curious if youd be willing to drive us to an underprivileged area that we have in mind here in New York City That seemed slightly more effective but still didnt work Then we started offering people 100 to drive us That got us even closer but when we told them to take us to Harlem they said no and drove off We had talked to about two dozen people who all said no My partners were ready to give up on the project but I said Its the law of averages somebody is going to say yes Sure enough the perfect van drove up It was perfect because it was extra big and would accommodate all of us We went up knocked on the window and we asked the driver Could you take us to a disadvantaged area Well pay you a hundred dollars The driver said You dont have to pay me Id be happy to take you In fact Ill take you to some of the most difficult spots in the whole city Then he reached over on the seat and grabbed his hat As he put it on I noticed that it said Salvation Army The mans name was  Captain John Rondon and he was the head of the Salvation Army in the South Bronx We climbed into the van in absolute ecstasy He said Ill take you places you never even thought of going But tell me something Why do you people want to do this I told him my story and that I wanted to show gratitude for all that I had by giving something back Captain Rondon took us into parts of the South Bronx that make Harlem look like Beverly Hills When we arrived we went into a store where we bought a lot of food and some baskets We packed enough for seven families for 30 days Then we went out to start feeding people We went to buildings where there were half a dozen people living in one room squatters with no electricity and no heat in the dead of winter surrounded by rats cockroaches and the smell of urine It was both an astonishing realization that people lived this way and a truly fulfilling experience to make even a small difference You see you can make anything happen if you commit to it and take action Miracles like this happen every dayeven in a city where there are no vans Anthony Robbins  Ask Ask Ask The greatest saleswoman in the world today doesnt mind if you call her a girl Thats because Markita Andrews has generated more than eighty thousand dollars selling Girl Scout cookies since she was seven years old Going doortodoor after school the painfully shy Markita transformed herself into a cookieselling dynamo when she discovered at age 13 the secret of selling It starts with desire Burning whitehot desire For Markita and her mother who worked as a waitress in New York after her husband left them when Markita was eight years old their dream was to travel the globe Ill work hard to make enough money to send you to college her mother said one day Youll go to college and when you graduate youll make enough money to take you and me around the world Okay So at age 13 when Markita read in her Girl Scout magazine that the Scout who sold the most cookies would win an allexpensespaid trip for two around the world she decided to sell all the Girl Scout cookies she couldmore Girl Scout cookies than anyone in the world ever But desire alone is not enough To make her dream come true Markita knew she needed a plan Always wear your right outfit your professional garb her aunt advised When you are doing business dress like you are doing business Wear your Girl Scout uniform When you go up to people in their tenement buildings at 430 or 630 and especially on Friday night ask for a big order Always smile whether they buy or not always be nice And dont ask them to buy your cookies ask them to invest Lots of other Scouts may have wanted that trip around the world Lots of other Scouts may have had a plan But only Markita went off in her uniform each day after school ready to askand keep asking folks to invest in her dream Hi I have a dream Im earning a trip around the world for me and my mom by merchandising Girl Scout cookies shed say at the door Would you like to invest in one dozen or two dozen boxes of cookies Markita sold 3526 boxes of Girl Scout cookies that year and won her trip around the world Since then she has sold more than 42000 boxes of Girl Scout cookies spoken at sales conventions across the country  starred in a Disney movie about her adventure and has coauthored the bestseller How to Sell More Cookies Condos Cadillacs Computers  And Everything Else Markita is no smarter and no more extroverted than thousands of other people young and old with dreams of their own The difference is Markita has discovered the secret of selling Ask Ask Ask Many people fail before they even begin because they fail to ask for what they want The fear of rejection leads many of us to reject ourselves and our dreams long before anyone else ever has the chanceno matter what were selling And everyone is selling something Youre selling yourself everyday in school to your boss to new people you meet said Markita at 14 My mother is a waitress she sells the daily special Mayors and presidents trying to get votes are selling One of my favorite teachers was Mrs Chapin She made geography interesting and thats really selling I see selling everywhere I look Selling is part of the whole world It takes courage to ask for what you want Courage is not the absence of fear Its doing what it takes despite ones fear And as Markita has discovered the more you ask the easier and more fun it gets Once on live TV the producer decided to give Markita her toughest selling challenge Markita was asked to sell Girl Scout cookies to another guest on the show Would you like to invest in one dozen or two dozen boxes of Girl Scout cookies she asked Girl Scout cookies I dont buy any Girl Scout cookies he replied Im a Federal Penitentiary warden I put 2000 rapists robbers criminals muggers and child abusers to bed every night Unruffled Markita quickly countered Mister if you take some of these cookies maybe you wont be so mean and angry and evil And Mister I think it would be a good idea for you to take some of these cookies back for every one of your 2000 prisoners too Markita asked The warden wrote a check Jack Canfield and Mark V Hansen  Did The Earth Move For You Elevenyearold Angela was stricken with a debilitating disease involving her nervous system She was unable to walk and her movement was restricted in other ways as well The doctors did not hold out much hope of her ever recovering from this illness They predicted shed spend the rest of her life in a wheelchair They said that few if any were able to come back to normal after contracting this disease The little girl was undaunted There lying in her hospital bed she would vow to anyone whod listen that she was definitely going to be walking again someday She was transferred to a specialized rehabilitation hospital in the San Francisco Bay area Whatever therapies could be applied to her case were used The therapists were charmed by her undefeatable spirit They taught her about imagingabout seeing herself walking If it would do nothing else it would at least give her hope and something positive to do in the long waking hours in her bed Angela would work as hard as possible in physical therapy in whirlpools and in exercise sessions But she worked just as hard lying there faithfully doing her imaging visualizing herself moving moving moving One day as she was straining with all her might to imagine her legs moving again it seemed as though a miracle happened The bed moved It began to move around the room She screamed out Look what Im doing Look Look I can do it I moved I moved Of course at this very moment everyone else in the hospital was screaming too and running for cover People were screaming equipment was falling and glass was breaking You see it was the recent San Francisco earthquake But dont tell that to Angela Shes convinced that she did it And now only a few years later shes back in school On her own two legs No crutches no wheelchair You see anyone who can shake the earth between San Francisco and Oakland can conquer a piddling little disease cant they Hanoch McCarty  Tommys Bumper Sticker A little kid down at our church in Huntington Beach came up to me after he heard me talk about the Childrens Bank He shook my hand and said My name is Tommy Tighe Im six years old and I want to borrow money from your Childrens Bank I said Tommy thats one of my goals to loan money to kids And so far all the kids have paid it back What do you want to do He said Ever since I was four I had a vision that I could cause peace in the world I want to make a bumper sticker that says PEACE PLEASE DO IT FOR US KIDS signed Tommy I can get behind that I said He needed 454 to produce 1000 bumper stickers The Mark Victor Hansen Childrens Free Enterprise Fund wrote a check to the printer who was printing the bumper stickers Tommys dad whispered in my ear If he doesnt pay the loan back are you going to foreclose on his bicycle I said No knock on wood every kid is born with honesty morality and ethics They have to be taught something else I believe hell pay us back If you have a child who is over nine let them work for money for someone honest moral and ethical so they learn the principle early We gave Tommy a copy of all of my tapes and he listened to them 21 times each and took ownership of the material It says Always start selling at the top Tommy convinced his dad to drive him up to Ronald Reagans home Tommy rang the bell and the gatekeeper came out Tommy gave a twominute irresistible sales presentation on his bumper sticker The gatekeeper reached in his pocket gave Tommy 150 and said Here I want one of those Hold on and Ill get the former President I asked Why did you ask him to buy He said You said in the tapes

and signed it Mikhail Gorbachev President Since I collect autographs I told Tommy Ill give you 50000 for Gorbachevs autograph He said No thanks Mark  I said Tommy I own several companies When you get older Id like to hire you Are you kidding he answered When I get older Im going to hire you The Sunday edition of the Orange County Register did a feature section on Tommys story the Childrens Free Enterprise Bank and me Marty Shaw the journalist interviewed Tommy for six hours and wrote a phenomenal interview Marty asked Tommy what he thought his impact would be on world peace Tommy said I dont think I am old enough yet I think you have to be eight or nine to stop all the wars in the world Marty asked Who are your heroes He said My dad George Burns Wally Joiner and Mark Victor Hansen Tommy has good taste in role models Three days later I got a call from the Hallmark Greeting Card Company A Hallmark franchisee had faxed a copy of the Register article They were having a convention in San Francisco and wanted Tommy to speak After all they saw that Tommy had nine goals for himself 1 Call about cost baseball card collateral 2 Have bumper sticker printed 3 Make a plan for a loan 4 Find

My wife Linda and I live in Miami Florida When we had just started our selfesteem training program called Little Acorns to teach children how to say no to drugs sexual promiscuity and other selfdestructive behavior we received a brochure for an educational conference in San Diego As we read the brochure and realized that everybody who is anybody was going to be there we realized we had to go But we didnt see how We were just getting started we were working out of our home and had just about exhausted our personal savings with the early stages of the work There was no way we could afford the airline tickets or any of the other expenses But we knew we had to be there so we started asking The first thing I did was to call the conference coordinators in San Diego explain why we just had to be there and ask them if they would give us two complimentary admissions to the conference When I explained our situation what we were doing and why we had to be there they said yes So now we had the tickets I told Linda we had the tickets and we could get into the conference She said Great But were in Miami and the conference is in San Diego What do we do next So I said Weve got to get transportation I called an airline I knew was doing well at the time Northeast Airlines The woman who answered happened to be the secretary to the president so I told her what I needed She put me directly through to the president Steve Quinto I explained to him that I had just talked to the conference people in San Diego they had given us free tickets to the conference but we were stuck on how to get there and would he please donate two roundtrip tickets from Miami to San Diego He said Of course I will just like that It was that fast and the next thing he said really floored me He said Thank you for asking I said Pardon me He said I dont often have the opportunity to do the best thing that I can for the world unless someone asks me to The best thing I can ever do is to give of myself and youve asked me to do that Thats a nice opportunity and I want to thank you for that opportunity I was blown away but I thanked him and hung up the phone I looked at my wife  and said Honey we got the plane tickets She said Great Where do we stay Next I called the Holiday Inn Downtown Miami and asked Where is your headquarters They told me it was in Memphis Tennessee so I called Tennessee and they patched me through to the person I needed to talk to It was a guy in San Francisco He controlled all of the Holiday Inns in California I then explained to him that we had obtained our plane tickets through the airlines and asked if there were some way he could help us with the lodging for the three days He asked if it would be okay if he put us up in their new hotel in downtown San Diego as his guest I said Yes that would be fine He then said Wait a minute I need to caution you that the hotel is about a 35mile drive from the campus where the conference is being held and youll have to find out how to get there I said Ill figure it out if I need to buy a horse I thanked him and I said to Linda Well honey weve got the admission weve got the plane tickets and weve got a place to stay What we need now is a way to get back and forth from the hotel to the campus twice a day Next I called National Car Rental told them the story and asked if they could help me out They said Would a new Olds 88 be okay I said it would be In one day we had put the whole thing together We did wind up buying our own meals for part of the time but before the conference was over I stood up told this story at one of the general assemblies and said Anyone who wants to volunteer to take us to lunch now and again would be graciously thanked About fifty people jumped up and volunteered so we wound up having some of the meals thrown in as well We had a marvelous time learned a lot and connected with people like Jack Canfield who is still on our advisory board When we returned we launched the program and its been growing about 100 percent a year This last June we graduated our 2250th family from the Little Acorn training Weve also held two major conferences for educators called Making The World Safe For Children to which weve invited people from all over the world Thousands of educators have come to get ideas on how to do selfesteem training in their classrooms while theyre still teaching the three Rs The last time we sponsored the conference we invited educators from 81 nations to come Seventeen nations sent representatives including some  ministers of education Out of that has grown invitations for us to take our program to the following places Russia Ukraine Byelorussia Gelaruth Kazakhstan Mongolia Taiwan the Cook Islands and New Zealand So you see you can get anything you want if you just ask enough people Rick Gelinas  Rick Littles Quest At 5 am Rick Little fell asleep at the wheel of his car hurtled over a tenfoot embankment and crashed into a tree He spent the next six months in traction with a broken back Rick found himself with a lot of time to think deeply about his lifesomething for which the thirteen years of his education had not prepared him Only two weeks after he was dismissed from the hospital he returned home one afternoon to find his mother lying semiconscious on the floor from an overdose of sleeping pills Rick confronted once again the inadequacy of his formal education in preparing him to deal with the social and emotional issues of his life During the following months Rick began to formulate an ideathe development of a course that would equip students with high selfesteem relationship skills and conflict management skills As Rick began to research what such a course should contain he ran across a study by the National Institute of Education in which 1000 30yearolds had been asked if they felt their high school education had equipped them with the skills they needed for the real world Over 80 percent responded Absolutely not These 30yearolds were also asked what skills they now wish they had been taught The top answers were relationship skills How to get along better with the people you live with How to find and keep a job How to handle conflict How to be a good parent How to understand the normal development of a child How to handle financial management And how to intuit the meaning of life Inspired by his vision of creating a class that might teach these things Rick dropped out of college and set across the country to interview high school students In his quest for information on what should be included in the course he asked over 2000 students in 120 high schools the same two questions 1 If you were to develop a program for your high school to help you cope with what youre meeting now and what you think youll be meeting in the future what would that program include 2 List the top ten problems in your life that you wish were dealt with better at home and in school Whether the students were from wealthy private schools or inner city ghettos rural or suburban the answers were surprisingly the same  Loneliness and not liking themselves topped the list of problems In addition they had the same list of skills they wished they were taught as the ones compiled by the 30yearolds Rick slept in his car for two months living on a total of 6000 Most days he ate peanut butter on crackers Some days he didnt eat at all Rick had few resources but he was committed to his dream His next step was to make a list of the nations top educators and leaders in counseling and psychology He set out to visit everyone on his list to ask for their expertise and support While they were impressed with his approachasking students directly what they wanted to learn they offered little help Youre too young Go back to college Get your degree Go to graduate school then you can pursue this They were less than encouraging Yet Rick persisted By the time he turned 20 he had sold his car his clothes had borrowed from friends and was 32000 in debt Someone suggested he go to a foundation and ask for money His first appointment at a local foundation was a huge disappointment As he walked into the office Rick was literally shaking with fear The vice president of the foundation was a huge darkhaired man with a cold stern face For a half hour he sat without uttering a word while Rick poured his heart out about his mother the two thousand kids and plans for a new kind of course for high school kids When he was through the vicepresident pushed up a stack of folders Son he said Ive been here nearly 20 years Weve funded all these education programs And they all failed Yours will too The reasons Theyre obvious Youre 20 years old you have no experience no money no college degree Nothing As he left the foundation office Rick vowed to prove this man wrong Rick began a study of which foundations were interested in funding projects for teenagers He then spent months writing grant proposals working from early morning until late at night Rick worked for over a year laboriously writing grant proposals each one carefully tailored to the interests and requirements of the individual foundations Each one went out with high hopes and each one came backrejected Proposal after proposal was sent out and rejected Finally after the 155th grant proposal had been turned down all of Ricks support began to crumble Ricks parents were begging him to go back to college and Ken Greene an educator who had left his job to help Rick write proposals said  Rick I have no money left and I have a wife and kids to support Ill wait for one more proposal But if its a turndown Ill have to go back to Toledo and to teaching Rick had one last chance Activated by desperation and conviction he managed to talk himself past several secretaries and he secured a lunch date with Dr Russ Mawby President of the Kellogg Foundation On their way to lunch they passed an ice cream stand Would you like one Mawby asked Rick nodded But his anxiety got the better of him He crushed the cone in his hand and with chocolate ice cream running between his fingers he made a surreptitious but frantic effort to shake it loose before Dr Mawby could note what had happened But Mawby did see it and bursting into laughter he went back to the vendor and brought Rick a bunch of paper napkins The young man climbed into the car redfaced and miserable How could he request funding for a new educational program when he couldnt even handle an ice cream cone Two weeks later Mawby phoned You asked for 55000 Were sorry but the trustees voted against it Rick felt tears pressing behind his eyes For two years he had been working for a dream which would now go down the drain However said Mawby the trustees did vote unanimously to give you 130000 The tears came then Rick could hardly even stammer out a thank you Since that time Rick Little has raised over 100000000 to fund his dream The Quest Skills Programs are currently taught in over 30000 schools in all 50 states and 32 countries Three million kids per year are being taught important life skills because one 19yearold refused to take no for an answer In 1989 because of the incredible success of Quest Rick Little expanded his dream and was granted 65000000 the second largest grant ever given in US history to create The International Youth Foundation The purpose of this foundation is to identify and expand successful youth programs all over the world Rick Littles life is a testament to the power of commitment to a high vision coupled with a willingness to keep on asking until one manifests the dream Adapted from Peggy Mann  The Magic Of Believing Im not old enough to play baseball or football Im not eight yet My mom told me when you start baseball you arent going to be able to run that fast because you had an operation I told Mom I wouldnt need to run that fast When I play baseball Ill just hit them out of the park Then Ill be able to walk Edward J McGrath Jr An Exceptional View of Life Glennas Goal Book In 1977 I was a single mother with three young daughters a house payment a car payment and a need to rekindle some dreams One evening I attended a seminar and heard a man speak on the I x V R Principle Imagination mixed with Vividness becomes Reality The speaker pointed out that the mind thinks in pictures not in words And as we vividly picture in our mind what we desire it will become a reality This concept struck a chord of creativity in my heart I knew the Biblical truth that the Lord gives us the desires of our heart Psalms 374 and that as a man thinketh in his heart so is he Proverbs 237 I was determined to take my written prayer list and turn it into pictures I began cutting up old magazines and gathering pictures that depicted the desires of my heart I arranged them in an expensive photo album and waited expectantly I was very specific with my pictures They included 1 A goodlooking man 2 A woman in a wedding gown and a man in a tuxedo 3 Bouquets of flowers Im a romantic 4 Beautiful diamond jewelry I rationalized that God loved David and Solomon and they were two of the richest men who ever lived 5 An island in the sparkling blue Caribbean 6 A lovely home 7 New furniture 8 A woman who had recently become vice president of a large corporation I was working for a company that had no female officers I wanted to be the first woman vice president in that company  About eight weeks later I was driving down a California freeway minding my own business at 1030 in the morning Suddenly a gorgeous redandwhite Cadillac passed me I looked at the car because it was a beautiful car And the driver looked at me and smiled and I smiled back because I always smile Now I was in deep trouble Have you ever done that I tried to pretend that I hadnt looked Who me I didnt look at you He followed me for the next 15 miles Scared me to death I drove a few miles he drove a few miles I parked he parked and eventually I married him On the first day after our first date Jim sent me a dozen roses Then I found out that he had a hobby His hobby was collecting diamonds Big ones And he was looking for somebody to decorate I volunteered We dated for about two years and every Monday morning I received a longstemmed red rose and a love note from him About three months before we were getting married Jim said to me I have found the perfect place to go on our honeymoon We will go to St Johns Island down in the Caribbean I laughingly said I never would have thought of that I did not confess the truth about my picture book until Jim and I had been married for almost a year It was then that we were moving into our gorgeous new home and furnishing it with the elegant furniture that I had pictured Jim turned out to be the West Coast wholesale distributor for one of the finest eastern furniture manufacturers By the way the wedding was in Laguna Beach California and included the gown and tuxedo as realities Eight months after I created my dream book I became the vice president of human resources in the company where I worked In some sense this sounds like a fairy tale but it is absolutely true Jim and I have made many picture books since we have been married God has filled our lives with the demonstration of these powerful principles of faith at work Decide what it is that you want in every area of your life Imagine it vividly Then act on your desires by actually constructing your personal goal book Convert your ideas into concrete realities through this simple exercise There are no impossible dreams And remember God has promised to give His children the desires of their heart Glenna Salsbury  Another Check Mark On The List One rainy afternoon an inspired 15yearold

It is better to be prepared for an opportunity and not have one than to have an opportunity and not be prepared Whitney Young Jr Les Brown and his twin brother were adopted by Mamie Brown a kitchen worker and maid shortly after their birth in a povertystricken Miami neighborhood Because of his hyperactivity and nonstop jabber Les was placed in special education classes for the learning disabled in grade school and throughout high school Upon graduation he became a city sanitation worker in Miami Beach But he had a dream of being a disc jockey At night he would take a transistor radio to bed where he listened to the local jivetalking deejays He created an imaginary radio station in his tiny room with its torn vinyl flooring A hairbrush served as his microphone as he practiced his patter introducing records to his ghost listeners His mother and brother could hear him through the thin walls and would shout at him to quit flapping his jaws and go to sleep But Les didnt listen to them He was wrapped up in his own world living a dream One day Les boldly went to the local radio station during his lunch break from mowing grass for the city He got into the station managers office and told him he wanted to be a disc jockey The manager eyed this disheveled young man in overalls and a straw hat and inquired Do you have any background in broadcasting Les replied No sir I dont Well son Im afraid we dont have a job for you then Les thanked him politely and left The station manager assumed that he had seen the last of this young man But he underestimated the depth of Les Browns commitment to his goal You see Les had a higher purpose than simply wanting to be a disc jockey He wanted to buy a nicer house for his adoptive mother whom he loved deeply The disc jockey job was merely a step toward his goal Mamie Brown had taught Les to pursue his dreams so he felt sure that he would get a job at that radio station in spite of what the station manager had said  And so Les returned to the station every day for a week asking if there were any job openings Finally the station manager gave in and took him on as an errand boyat no pay At first he fetched coffee or picked up lunches and dinner for the deejays who could not leave the studio Eventually his enthusiasm for their work won him the confidence of the disc jockeys who would send him in their Cadillacs to pick up visiting celebrities such as the Temptations and Diana Ross and the Supremes Little did any of them know that young Les did not have a drivers license Les did whatever was asked of him at the stationand more While hanging out with the deejays he taught himself their hand movements on the control panel He stayed in the control rooms and soaked up whatever he could until they asked him to leave Then back in his bedroom at night he practiced and prepared himself for the opportunity that he knew would present itself One Saturday afternoon while Les was at the station a deejay named Rock was drinking while on the air Les was the only other person in the building and he realized that Rock was drinking himself toward trouble Les stayed close He walked back and forth in front of the window in Rocks booth As he prowled he said to himself Drink Rock drink Les was hungry and he was ready He would have run down the street for more booze if Rock had asked When the phone rang Les pounced on it It was that station manager as he knew it would be Les this is Mr Klein  Yes said Les I know Les I dont think Rock can finish his program Yes sir I know Would you call one of the other deejays to come in and take over Yes sir I sure will But when Les hung up the telephone he said to himself Now he must think Im crazy Les did dial the telephone but it wasnt to call in another deejay He called his mother first and then his girlfriend You all go out on the front porch and turn up the radio because Im about to come on the air he said He waited about 15 minutes before he called the general manager Mr Klein I cant find nobody Les said Mr Klein then asked Young man do you know how to work the controls in the studio  Yes sir replied Les Les darted into the booth gently moved Rock aside and sat down at the turntable He was ready And he was hungry He flipped on the microphone switch and said Look out This is me LB triple PLes Brown Your Platter Playing Poppa There were none before me and there will be none after me Therefore that makes me the one and only Young and single and love to mingle Certified bona fide indubitably qualified to bring you satisfaction a whole lot of action Look out baby Im your looove man Because of his preparation Les was ready He wowed the audience and his general manager From that fateful beginning Les went on to a successful career in broadcasting politics public speaking and television Jack Canfield  Willing To Pay The Price When my wife Maryanne and I were building our Greenspoint Mall hair salon 13 years ago a Vietnamese fellow would stop by each day to sell us doughnuts He spoke hardly any English but he was always friendly and through smiles and sign language we got to know each other His name was Le Van Vu During the day Le worked in a bakery and at night he and his wife listened to audio tapes to learn English I later learned that they slept on sacks full of sawdust on the floor of the back room of the bakery In Vietnam the Van Vu family was one of the wealthiest in Southeast Asia They owned almost onethird of North Vietnam including huge holdings in industry and real estate However after his father was brutally murdered Le moved to South Vietnam with his mother where he went to school and eventually became a lawyer Like his father before him Le prospered He saw an opportunity to construct buildings to accommodate the everexpanding American presence in South Vietnam and soon became one of the most successful builders in the country On a trip to the North however Le was captured by the North Vietnamese and thrown into prison for three years He escaped by killing five soldiers and made his way back to South Vietnam where he was arrested again The South Vietnamese government had assumed he was a plant from the North After serving time in prison Le got out and started a fishing company eventually becoming the largest canner in South Vietnam When Le learned that the US troops and embassy personnel were about to pull out of his country he made a lifechanging decision He took all of the gold he had hoarded loaded it aboard one of his fishing vessels and sailed with his wife out to the American ships in the harbor He then exchanged all his riches for safe passage out of Vietnam to the Philippines where he and his wife were taken into a refugee camp After gaining access to the president of the Philippines Le convinced him to make one of his boats available for fishing and Le was back in business again Before he left the Philippines two years later en route for America his ultimate dream Le had successfully developed the entire fishing industry in the Philippines  But en route to America Le became distraught and depressed about having to start over again with nothing His wife tells of how she found him near the railing of the ship about to jump overboard Le she told him if you do jump whatever will become of me Weve been together for so long and through so much We can do this together It was all the encouragement that Le Van Vu needed When he and his wife arrived in Houston in 1972 they were flat broke and spoke no English In Vietnam family takes care of family and Le and his wife found themselves ensconced in the back room of his cousins bakery in the Greenspoint Mall We were building our salon just a couple of hundred feet away Now as they say here comes the message part of this story Les cousin offered both Le and his wife jobs in the bakery After taxes Le would take home 175 per week his wife 125 Their total annual income in other words was 15600 Further his cousin offered to sell them the bakery whenever they could come up with a 30000 down payment The cousin would finance the remainder with a note for 90000 Heres what Le and his wife did Even with a weekly income of 300 they decided to continue to live in the back room They kept clean by taking sponge baths for two years in the malls restrooms For two years their diet consisted almost entirely of bakery goods Each year for two years they lived on a total thats right a total of 600 saving 30000 for the down payment Le later explained his reasoning If we got ourselves an apartment which we could afford on 300 per week wed have to pay the rent Then of course wed have to buy furniture Then wed have to have transportation to and from work so that meant wed have to buy a car Then wed have to buy gasoline for the car as well as insurance Then wed probably want to go places in the car so that meant wed need to buy clothes and toiletries So I knew that if we got that apartment wed never get our 30000 together Now if you think youve heard everything about Le let me tell you theres more After he and his wife had saved the 30000 and bought the bakery Le once again sat down with his wife for a serious chat They still owed 90000 to his cousin he said and as difficult as the past two years had been they had to remain living in that back room for one more year  Im proud to tell you that in one year my friend and mentor Le Van Vu and his wife saving virtually every nickel of profit from the business paid off the 90000 note and in just three years owned an extremely profitable business free and clear Then and only then the Van Vus went out and got their first apartment To this day they continue to save on a regular basis live on an extremely small percentage of their income and of course always pay cash for any of their purchases Do you think that Le Van Vu is a millionaire today I am happy to tell you many times over John McCormack  Everybody Has A Dream Some years ago I took on an assignment in a southern county to work with people on public welfare What I wanted to do was show that everybody has the capacity to be selfsufficient and all we have to do is to activate them I asked the county to pick a group of people who were on public welfare people from different racial groups and different family constellations I would then see them as a group for three hours every Friday I also asked for a little petty cash to work with as I needed it The first thing I said after I shook hands with everybody was I would like to know what your dreams are Everyone looked at me as if I were kind of wacky Dreams We dont have dreams I said Well when you were a kid what happened Wasnt there something you wanted to do One woman said to me I dont know what you can do with dreams The rats are eating up my kids Oh I said Thats terrible No of course you are very much involved with the rats and your kids How can that be helped Well I could use a new screen door because there are holes in my screen door I asked Is there anybody around here who knows how to fix a screen door There was a man in the group and he said A long time ago I used to do things like that but now I have a terribly bad back but Ill try I told him I had some money if he would go to the store and buy some screening and go and fix the ladys screen door Do you think you can do that Yes Ill try The next week when the group was seated I said to the woman Well is your screen door fixed Oh yes she said Then we can start dreaming cant we She sort of smiled at me I said to the man who did the work How do you feel He said Well you know its a very funny thing Im beginning to feel a lot better  That helped the group to begin to dream These seemingly small successes allowed the group to see that dreams were not insane These small steps began to get people to see and feel that something really could happen I began to ask other people about their dreams One woman shared that she always wanted to be a secretary I said Well what stands in your way Thats always my next question She said I have six kids and I dont have anyone to take care of them while Im away Lets find out I said Is there anybody in this group who would take care of six kids for a day or two a week while this woman gets some training here at the community college One woman said I got kids too but I could do that Lets do it I said So a plan was created and the woman went to school Everyone found something The man who put in the screen door became a handyman The woman who took in the children became a licensed foster care person In 12 weeks I had all these people off public welfare Ive not only done that once Ive done it many times Virginia Satir  Follow Your Dream I have a friend named Monty Roberts who owns a horse ranch in San Ysidro He has let me use his house to put on fundraising events to raise money for youth at risk programs The last time I was there he introduced me by saying I want to tell you why I let Jack use my house It all goes back to a story about a young man who was the son of an itinerant horse trainer who would go from stable to stable race track to race track farm to farm and ranch to ranch training horses As a result the boys high school career was continually interrupted When he was a senior he was asked to write a paper about what he wanted to be and do when he grew up That night he wrote a sevenpage paper describing his goal of someday owning a horse ranch He wrote about his dream in great detail and he even drew a diagram of a 200acre ranch showing the location of all the buildings the stables and the track Then he drew a detailed floor plan for a 4000squarefoot house that would sit on the 200acre dream ranch He put a great deal of his heart into the project and the next day he handed it in to his teacher Two days later he received his paper back On the front page was a large red F with a note that read See me after class The boy with the dream went to see the teacher after class and asked Why did I receive an F The teacher said This is an unrealistic dream for a young boy like you You have no money You come from an itinerant family You have no resources Owning a horse ranch requires a lot of money You have to buy the land You have to pay for the original breeding stock and later youll have to pay large stud fees Theres no way you could ever do it Then the teacher added If you will rewrite this paper with a more realistic goal I will reconsider your grade The boy went home and thought about it long and hard He asked his father what he should do His father said Look son you have to make up your own mind on this However I think it is a very important decision for you Finally after sitting with it for a week the boy turned in the same paper making no changes at all He stated You can keep the F and Ill keep my dream Monty then turned to the assembled group and said I tell you this story because you are sitting in my 4000squarefoot house in the middle of my 200acre horse ranch I still have that school paper framed over the fireplace He added The best part of the story is that two summers ago that same schoolteacher brought 30 kids to camp out on my ranch for a week When the teacher was leaving he said Look Monty I can tell you this now When I was your teacher I was something of a dream stealer During those years I stole a lot of kids dreams Fortunately you had enough gumption not to give up on yours Dont let anyone steal your dreams Follow your heart no matter what Jack Canfield  The Box When I was a senior in college I came home for Christmas vacation and anticipated a funfilled fortnight with my two brothers We were so excited to be together we volunteered to watch the store so that my mother and father could take their first day off in years The day before my parents went to Boston my father took me quietly aside to the little den behind the store The room was so small that it held only a piano and a hideabed couch In fact when you pulled the bed out it filled the room and you could sit on the foot of it and play the piano Father reached behind the old upright and pulled out a cigar box He opened it and showed me a little pile of newspaper articles I had read so many Nancy Drew detective stories that I was excited and wideeyed over the hidden box of clippings What are they I asked Father replied seriously These are articles Ive written and some letters to the editor that have been published As I began to read I saw at the bottom of each neatly clipped article the name Walter Chapman Esq Why didnt you tell me youd done this I asked Because I didnt want your mother to know She has always told me that since I didnt have much education I shouldnt try to write I wanted to run for some political office also but she told me I shouldnt try I guess she was afraid shed be embarrassed if I lost I just wanted to try for the fun of it I figured I could write without her knowing it and so I did When each item would be printed Id cut it out and hide it in this box I knew someday Id show the box to someone and its you He watched me as I read over a few of the articles and when I looked up his big blue eyes were moist I guess I tried for something too big this last time he added Did you write something else Yes I sent some suggestions in to our denominational magazine on how the national nominating committee could be selected more fairly Its been three months since I sent it in I guess I tried for something too big This was such a new side to my funloving father that I didnt quite know what to say so I tried Maybe itll still come Maybe but dont hold your breath Father gave me a little smile and a wink and then closed the cigar box and tucked it into the space behind the piano  The next morning our parents left on the bus to the Haverhill Depot where they took a train to Boston Jim Ron and I ran the store and I thought about the box Id never known my father liked to write I didnt tell my brothers it was a secret between Father and me The Mystery of the Hidden Box Early that evening I looked out the store window and saw my mother get off the busalone She crossed the Square and walked briskly through the store Wheres Dad we asked together Your fathers dead she said without a tear In disbelief we followed her to the kitchen where she told us they had been walking through the Park Street Subway Station in the midst of crowds of people when Father had fallen to the floor A nurse bent over him looked up at Mother and said simply Hes dead Mother had stood by him stunned not knowing what to do as people tripped over him in their rush through the subway A priest said Ill call the police and disappeared Mother straddled Dads body for about an hour Finally an ambulance came and took them both to the only morgue where Mother had to go through his pockets and remove his watch Shed come back on the train alone and then home on the local bus Mother told us the shocking tale without shedding a tear Not showing emotion had always been a matter of discipline and pride for her We didnt cry either and we took turns waiting on the customers One steady patron asked Wheres the old man tonight Hes dead I replied Oh too bad and he left Id not thought of him as the old man and I was mad at the question but he was 70 and Mother was only 60 Hed always been healthy and happy and hed cared for frail mother without complaining and now he was gone No more whistling no more singing hymns while stocking shelves The old man was gone On the morning of the funeral I sat at the table in the store opening sympathy cards and pasting them in a scrapbook when I noticed the church magazine in the pile Normally I would never have opened what I viewed as a dull religious publication but just maybe that sacred article might be thereand it was I took the magazine to the little den shut the door and burst into tears Id been brave but seeing Dads bold recommendations to the national convention in print was more than I could bear I read and cried and then I read again I pulled out the box from behind the piano and  under the clippings I found a twopage letter to my father from Henry Cabot Lodge Sr thanking him for his campaign suggestions I didnt tell anyone about my box It remained a secret Florence Littauer  Encouragement Some of the greatest success stories of history have followed a word of encouragement or an act of confidence by a loved one or a trusted friend Had it not been for a confident wife Sophia we might not have listed among the great names of literature the name of Nathaniel Hawthorne When Nathaniel a heartbroken man went home to tell his wife that he was a failure and had been fired from his job in a customhouse she surprised him with an exclamation of joy Now she said triumphantly you can write your book Yes replied the man with sagging confidence and what shall we live on while I am writing it To his amazement she opened a drawer and pulled out a substantial amount of money Where on earth did you get that he exclaimed I have always known you were a man of genius she told him I knew that someday you would write a masterpiece So every week out of the money you gave me for housekeeping I saved a little bit So here is enough to last us for one whole year From her trust and confidence came one of the greatest novels of American literature The Scarlet Letter Nido Oubein  Walt Jones The big question is whether you are going to be able to say a hearty yes to your adventure Joseph Campbell No one epitomizes the fact that success is a journey and not a destination than the many green and growing human becomings who do not allow age to be a deterrent to accomplishment Florence Brooks joined the Peace Corps when she was 64 years of age Gladys Clappison was living in the dormitory at the University of Iowa working on her PhD in history at age 82 Then there was Ed Stitt who at age 87 was working on his community college degree program in New Jersey Ed said it kept him from getting oldtimers disease and kept his brain alive Probably no one person has stirred my imagination over the years more than Walt Jones of Tacoma Washington Walt outlived his third wife to whom he was married for 52 years When she died someone said to Walt that it must be sad losing such a longtime friend His response was Well of course it was but then again it may be for the best Why was that I dont want to be negative or say anything to defame her wonderful character but she kind of petered out on me in the last decade When asked to explain he went on to add She just never wanted to do nothin just kind of became a stickinthemud Ten years ago when I was 94 I told my wife we aint never seen nothin except the beautiful Pacific Northwest She asked me what was on my mind and I told her I was thinkin about buying a motor home and maybe we could visit all 48 of the contiguous states What do you think of that She said 1 think youre out of your mind Walt Whydya say that I asked Wed get mugged out there Wed die and there wouldnt be a funeral parlor Then she asked me Whos going to drive Walter and I said I am Lambie Youll kill us she said Id like to make footprints in the sands of time before I check out but you cant make footprints in the sands of time if youre sitting on your butt unless your intent is to make buttprints in the sands of time So now that shes gone Walt what do you intend to do  What do I intend to do I buried the old gal and bought me a motor home This is 1976 and I intend to visit all 48 of the states to celebrate our bicentennial Walt got to 43 of the states that year selling curios and souvenirs When asked if he ever picked up hitchhikers he said No way Too many of them will club you over the head for four bits or sue you for whiplash if you get into an accident Walt hadnt had his motor home but a few months and his wife had only been buried for six months when he was seen driving down the street with a rather attractive 62yearold woman at his side Walt he was asked Yeah he replied Who was the woman sitting by your side Whos your new lady friend Walt To which he replied Yes she is Yes she is what My lady friend Lady friend Walt youve been married three times youre 104 years of age This woman must be four decades younger than you Well he responded I quickly discovered that man cannot live in a motor home alone I can understand that Walt You probably miss having someone to talk to after having had a companion all these years Without hesitation Walt replied You know I miss that too Too Are you inferring that you have a romantic interest I just might Walt  What he said There comes a time in a persons life when you knock that stuff off Sex he replied Yes Why he asked Well because that kind of physical exertion could be hazardous to a persons health Walt considered the question and said Well if she dies she dies In 1978 with double digit inflation heating up in our country Walt was a major investor in a condominium development When asked why he was taking his money out of a secure bank account and putting it into a condo development he said Aint you heard These are inflationary  times Youve got to put your money into real property so it will appreciate and be around for your later years when you really need it Hows that for positive thinking In 1980 he sold off a lot of his property in and around Pierce County Washington Many people thought Walt was cashing in his chips He assembled his friends and quickly made it clear that he was not cashing in his chips but he had sold off the property for cash flow I took a small down and a 30year contract I got four grand a month comin in until Im 138 He celebrated his 110th birthday on the Johnny Carson Show He walked out resplendent in his white beard and black hat looking a little like the late Colonel Sanders and Johnny says Its good to have you here Walt Its good to be anywhere at 110 Johnny 110 110 110 Whats the matter Carson you losin your hearin Thats what I said Thats what I am Whats the big deal The big deal is youre within three days of being twice as old as I am That would get your attention wouldnt it One hundred and ten years of agea green growing human becoming Walt picked up the opening and quickly alluded to Johnny How old would you be if you didnt know the date you were born and there werent no durned calendar to semidepress you once a year Ever heard of people getting depressed because of a calendar date Oh Lordy I hit my 30th birthday Im so depressed Im over the hill Oh no I hit my 40th birthday Everybody in my work team dressed in black and sent a hearse to pick me up Oh no Im 50 years old Half a century old They sent me dead roses with cobwebs Johnny who says youre supposed to roll over and die when youre 65 I have friends more prosperous since they were 75 than they were before And as a result of a little condominium investment I made a few years ago Ive made more bucks since I was 105 than I did before Can I give you my definition of depression Johnny Go ahead Missing a birthday  May the story of Walt Jones inspire all of us to remain green and growing every day of our lives Bob Monwad  Are You Strong Enough To Handle Critics It is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs and comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcomings who knows the great devotion who spends himself in a worthy cause who at best knows in the end the high achievement of triumph and who at worst if he fails while daring greatly knows his place shall never be with those timid and cold souls who know neither victory nor defeat Theodore Roosevelt Risking Two seeds lay side by side in the fertile spring soil The first seed said I want to grow I want to send my roots deep into the soil beneath me and thrust my sprouts through the earths crust above me I want to unfurl my tender buds like banners to announce the arrival of spring I want to feel the warmth of the sun on my face and the blessing of the morning dew on my petals And so she grew The second seed said I am afraid If I send my roots into the ground below I dont know what I will encounter in the dark If I push my way through the hard soil above me I may damage my delicate sprouts  what if I let my buds open and a snail tries to eat them And if I were to open my blossoms a small child may pull me from the ground No it is much better for me to wait until it is safe And so she waited A yard hen scratching around in the early spring ground for food found the waiting seed and promptly ate it MORAL OF THE STORY Those of us who refuse to risk and grow get swallowed up by life Patty Hansen  Try Something Different When we first read the following story we had just begun teaching a course called The Million Dollar Forum a course designed to teach people to accelerate their income up to levels of a million dollars a year or more Early on we discovered people get locked into a rut of tryirg harder without trying smarter Trying harder doesnt always work Sometimes we need to do something radically different to achieve greater levels of success We need to break out of our paradigm prisons our habit patterns and our comfort zones  Im sitting in a quiet room at the Milcroft Inn a peaceful little place hidden back among the pine trees about an hour out of Toronto Its just past noon late July and Im listenirg to the desperate sounds of a lifeordeath struggle going on a few feet away Theres a small fly burning out the last of its short lifes energies in a futile attempt to fly through the glass of the windowpane The whining wings tell the poignant story of the flys strategy Try harder But its not working The frenzied effort offers no hope for survival Ironically the struggle is part of the trap It is impossible for the fly to try hard enough to succeed at breaking through the glass Nevertheless this little insect has staked its life on reaching its goal through raw effort and determination This fly is doomed It will die there on the windowsill Across the room ten steps away the door is open Ten seconds of flying time and this small creature could reach the outside world it seeks With only a fraction of the effort now being wasted it could be free of this selfimposed trap The breakthrough possibility is there It would be so easy Why doesnt the fly try another approach something dramatically different How did it get so locked in on the idea that this particular route and determined effort offer the most promise for success What logic is there in continuing until death to seek a breakthrough with more of the same No doubt this approach makes sense to the fly Regrettably its an idea that will kill  Trying harder isnt necessarily the solution to achieving more It may not offer any real promise for getting what you want out of life Sometimes in fact its a big part of the problem If you stake your hopes for a breakthrough on trying harder than ever you may kill your chances for success Price Pritchett  Service With A Smile A man wrote a letter to a small hotel in a midwest town he planned to visit on his vacation He wrote I would very much like to bring my dog with me He is wellgroomed and very wellbehaved Would you be willing to permit me to keep him in my room with me at night An immediate reply came from the hotel owner who said Ive been operating this hotel for many years In all that time Ive never had a dog steal towels bed clothes or silverware or pictures off the walls Ive never had to evict a dog in the middle of the night for being drunk and disorderly And Ive never had a dog run out on a hotel bill Yes indeed

used to fight on and just published his latest book Mrs Phillips You Were Wrong Louisa May Alcott the author of Little Women was encouraged to find work as a servant or seamstress by her family Beethoven handled the violin awkwardly and preferred playing his own compositions instead of improving his technique His teacher called him hopeless as a composer The parents of the famous opera singer Enrico Caruso wanted him to be an engineer His teacher said he had no voice at all and could not sing Charles Darwin father of the Theory of Evolution gave up a medical career and was told by his father You care for nothing but shooting dogs and rat catching In his autobiography Darwin wrote I was considered by all my masters and by my father a very ordinary boy rather below the common standard in intellect Walt Disney was fired by a newspaper editor for lack of ideas Walt Disney also went bankrupt several times before he built Disneyland Thomas Edisons teachers said he was too stupid to learn anything Albert Einstein did not speak until he was four years old and didnt read until he was seven His teacher described him as mentally slow unsociable and adrift forever in his

become Prime Minister of England until he was 62 and then only after a lifetime of defeats and setbacks His greatest contributions came when he was a senior citizen Eighteen publishers turned down Richard Bachs 10000word story about a soaring seagull Jonathan Livingston Seagull before Macmillan finally published it in 1970 By 1975 it had sold more than 7 million copies in the US alone Richard Hooker worked for seven years on his humorous war novel MASH only to have it rejected by 21 publishers before Morrow decided to publish it It became a runaway bestseller spawning a blockbusting movie and a highly successful television series Jack Canfield and Mark V Hansen  John CorcoranThe Man Who Couldnt Read For as long as John Corcoran could remember words had mocked him The letters in sentences traded places vowel sounds lost themselves in the tunnels of his ears In school hed sit at his desk stupid and silent as a stone knowing he would be different from everyone else forever If only someone had sat next to that little boy put an arm around his shoulder and said Ill help you Dont be scared But no one had heard of dyslexia then And John couldnt tell them that the left side of his brain the lobe humans use to arrange symbols logically in a sequence had always misfired Instead in second grade they put him in the dumb row In third grade a nun handed a yardstick to the other children when John refused to read or write and let each student have a crack at his legs In fourth grade his teacher called on him to read and let one minute of quiet pile upon another until the child thought he would suffocate Then he was passed on to the next grade and the next John Corcoran never failed a year in his life In his senior year John was voted homecoming king went steady with the valedictorian and starred on the basketball team His mom kissed him when he graduatedand kept talking about college College It would be insane to consider But he finally decided on the University of Texas at El Paso where he could try out for the basketball team He took a deep breath closed his eyes and recrossed enemy lines On campus John asked each new friend Which teachers gave essay tests Which gave multiple choice The minute he stepped out of a class he tore the pages of scribble from his notebook in case anyone asked to see his notes He stared at thick textbooks in the evening so his roommate wouldnt doubt And he lay in bed exhausted but unable to sleep unable to make his whirring mind let go John promised hed go to Mass 30 days straight at the crack of dawn if only God would let him get his degree He got the diploma He gave God his 30 days of Mass Now what Maybe he was addicted to the edge Maybe the thing he felt most insecure abouthis mindwas what he needed most to have admired Maybe thats why in 1961 John became a teacher John taught in California Each day he had a student read the textbook to the class He gave standardized tests that he could grade by placing a  form with holes over each correct answer and he lay in bed for hours on weekend mornings depressed Then he met Kathy an A student and a nurse Not a leaf like John A rock Theres something I have to tell you Kathy he said one night in 1965 before their marriage I I cant read Hes a teacher she thought He must mean he cant read well Kathy didnt understand until years later when she saw John unable to read a childrens book to their 18monthold daughter Kathy filled out his forms read and wrote his letters Why didnt he simply ask her to teach him to read and write He couldnt believe that anyone could teach him At age 28 John borrowed 2500 bought a second house fixed it up and rented it He bought and rented another And another His business got bigger and bigger until he needed a secretary a lawyer and a partner Then one day his accountant told him he was a millionaire Perfect Whod notice that a millionaire always pulled on the doors that said PUSH or paused before entering public bathrooms waiting to see which one the men walked out of In 1982 the bottom began to fall out His properties started to sit empty and investors pulled out Threats of foreclosures and lawsuits tumbled out of envelopes Every waking moment it seemed he was pleading with bankers to extend his loans coaxing builders to stay on the job trying to make sense of the pyramid of paper Soon he knew theyd have him on the witness stand and the man in black robes would say The truth John Corcoran Cant you even read Finally in the fall of 1986 at age 48 John did two things he swore he never would He put up his house as collateral to obtain one last construction loan And he walked into the Carlsbad City Library and told the woman in charge of the tutoring program I cant read Then he cried He was placed with a 65yearold grandmother named Eleanor Condit Painstakinglyletter by letter phoneticallyshe began teaching him Within 14 months his landdevelopment company began to revive And John Corcoran was learning to read The next step was confession a speech before 200 stunned businessmen in San Diego To heal he had to come clean He was placed on the board of directors of the San Diego Council on Literacy and began traveling across the country to give speeches  Illiteracy is a form of slavery he would cry We cant waste time blaming anyone We need to become obsessed with teaching people to read He read every book or magazine he could get his hands on every road sign he passed out loud as long as Kathy could bear it It was glorious like singing And now he could sleep Then one day it occurred to himone more thing he could finally do Yes that dusty box in his office that sheaf of papers bound by ribbon  a quartercentury later John Corcoran could read his wifes love letters Gary Smith Dont

Daniels passion for surfing began at the age of 13 Before and after school each day he donned his wet suit paddled out beyond the surf line and waited to be challenged by his three to sixfoot companions Daniels love of the ride was tested one fateful afternoon Your sons been in an accident the lifeguard reported over the phone to my husband Mike How bad Bad When he surfaced to the top of the water the point of the board was headed toward his eye Mike rushed him to the emergency room and they were then sent to a plastic surgeons office He received 26 stitches from the corner of his eye to the bridge of his nose I was on an airplane flying home from a speaking engagement while Dans eye was being stitched Mike drove directly to the airport after they left the doctors office He greeted me at the gate and told me Dan was waiting in the car Daniel I questioned I remember thinking the waves must have been lousy that day Hes been in an accident but hes going to be fine A traveling working mothers worst nightmare had come true I ran to the car so fast the heel of my shoe broke off I swung open the door and my youngest son with the patched eye was leaning forward with both arms stretched out toward me crying Oh Ma Im so glad youre home I sobbed in his arms telling him how awful I felt about not being there when the lifeguard called Its okay Mom he comforted me You dont know how to surf anyway What I asked confused by his logic Ill be fine The doctor says I can go back in the water in eight days Was he out of his mind I wanted to tell him he wasnt allowed to go near water again until he was 35 but instead I bit my tongue and prayed he would forget about surfing forevermore For the next seven days he kept pressing me to let him go back on the board One day after I emphatically repeated No to him for the 100th time he beat me at my own game  Mom you taught us never to give up what we love Then he handed me a bribea framed poem by Langston Hughes that he bought

Passionate people embrace what they love and never give up Danielle Kennedy  Failure No Just Temporary Setbacks To see things in the seed that is genius Laotzu If you could come to my office in California to visit with me today you would notice across one side of the room a beautiful oldfashioned Spanish tile and mahogany soda fountain with nine leathercovered stools the kind they used to have in the old drug stores Unusual Yes But if those stools could speak they would tell you a story about the day I almost lost hope and gave up It was a recession period after World War II and jobs were scarce Cowboy Bob my husband had purchased a small dry cleaning business with borrowed money We had two darling babies a tract home a car and all the usual time payments Then the bottom fell out There was no money for the house payments or anything else I felt that I had no special talent no training no college education I didnt think much of myself But I remembered someone in my past who thought I had a little abilitymy Alhambra High School English teacher She inspired me to take journalism and named me advertising manager and feature editor of the school paper I thought Now if I could write a Shoppers Column for the small weekly newspaper in our rural town maybe I could earn that house payment I had no car and no babysitter So I pushed my two children before me in a rickety baby stroller with a big pillow tied in the back The wheel kept coming off but I hit it back on with the heel of my shoe and kept going I was determined that my children would not lose their home as I often had done as a child But at the newspaper office there were no jobs available Recession So I caught an idea I asked if I might buy advertising space at wholesale and sell it at retail as a Shoppers Column They agreed telling me later that they mentally gave me about a week of pushing that beatup heavily laden stroller down those country roads before I gave up But they were wrong The newspaper column idea worked I made enough money for the house payment and to buy an old used car that Cowboy Bob found for me Then I hired a high school girl to babysit from three to five each  afternoon When the clock struck three I grabbed my newspaper samples and flew out of the door to drive to my appointments But on one dark rainy afternoon every advertising prospect I had worked on turned me down when I went to pick up their copy Why I asked They said they had noticed that Ruben Ahlman the President of the Chamber of Commerce and the owner of the Rexall Drug store did not advertise with me His store was the most popular in town They respected his judgment There must be something wrong with your advertising they explained My heart sank Those four ads would have made the house payment Then I thought I will try to speak with Mr Ahlman one more time Everyone loves and respects him Surely he will listen Every time I had tried to approach him in the past he had refused to see me He was always out or unavailable I knew that if he advertised with me the other merchants in town would follow his lead This time as I walked into the Rexall drug store he was there at the prescription counter in the back I smiled my best smile and held up my precious Shoppers Column carefully marked in my childrens green crayola I said Everyone respects your opinion Mr Ahlman Would you just look at my work for a moment so that I can tell the other merchants what you think His mouth turned perpendicular in an upside down U Without saying a word he emphatically shook his head in the chilling negative gesture NO My knotted heart fell to the floor with such a thud I thought everyone must have heard it Suddenly all of my enthusiasm left me I made it as far as the beautiful old soda fountain at the front of the drug store feeling that I didnt have the strength to drive home I didnt want to sit at the soda fountain without buying something so I pulled out my last dime and ordered a cherry Coke I wondered desperately what to do Would my babies lose their home as I had so many times when I was growing up Was my journalism teacher wrong Maybe that talent she talked about was just a dud My eyes filled with tears A soft voice beside me on the next soda fountain stool said What is the matter dear I looked up into the sympathetic face of a lovely grey haired lady I poured out my story to her ending it with But Mr Ahlman who everyone respects so much will not look at my work Let me see that Shoppers Column she said She took my marked issue of the newspaper in her hands and carefully read it all the way  through Then she spun around on the stool stood up looked back at the prescription counter and in a commanding voice that could be heard down the block said Ruben Ahlman come here The lady was Mrs Ahlman She told Ruben to buy the advertising from me His mouth turned up the other way in a big grin Then she asked me for the names of the four merchants who had turned me down She went to the phone and called each one She gave me a hug and told me they were waiting for me and to go back and pick up their ads Ruben and Vivian Ahlman became our dear friends as well as steady advertising customers I learned that Ruben was a darling man who bought from everyone He had promised Vivian not to buy any more advertising He was just trying to keep his word to her If I had only asked others in town I might have learned that I should have been talking to Mrs Ahlman from the beginning That conversation on the stools of the soda fountain was the turning point My advertising business prospered and grew into four offices with 285 employees serving 4000 continuous contract advertising accounts Later when Mr Ahlman modernized the old drug store and removed the soda fountain my sweet husband Bob bought it and installed it in my office If you were here in California we would sit on the soda fountain stools together Id pour you a cherry Coke and remind you to never give up to remember that help is always closer than we know Then I would tell you that if you cant communicate with a key person search for more information Try another path around Look for someone who can communicate for you in a third person endorsement And finally I would serve you these sparkling refreshing words of Bill Marriott of the Marriott Hotels Failure I never encountered it

blessing or a curse Don Juan Roger Crawford had everything he needed to play tennisexcept two hands and a leg When Rogers parents saw their son for the first time they saw a baby with a thumblike projection extended directly out of his right forearm and a thumb and one finger stuck out of his left forearm He had no palms The babys arms and legs were shortened and he had only three toes on his shrunken right foot and a withered left leg which would later be amputated The doctor said Roger suffered from ectrodactylism a rare birth defect affecting only one out of 90000 children born in the United States The doctor said Roger would probably never walk or care for himself Fortunately Rogers parents didnt believe the doctor My parents always taught me that I was only as handicapped as I wanted to be said Roger They never allowed me to feel sorry for myself or take advantage of people because of my handicap Once I got into trouble because my school papers were continually late explained Roger who had to hold his pencil with both hands to write slowly I asked Dad to write a note to my teachers asking for a twoday extension on my assignments Instead Dad made me start writing my paper two days early Rogers father always encouraged him to get involved in sports teaching Roger to catch and throw a volleyball and play backyard football after school At age 12 Roger managed to win a spot on the school football team Before every game Roger would visualize his dream of scoring a touchdown Then one day he got his chance The ball landed in his arms and off he ran as fast as he could on his artificial leg toward the goal line his coach and teammates cheering wildly But at the tenyard line a guy from the other team caught up with Roger grabbing his left ankle Roger tried to pull his artificial leg free but instead it ended up being pulled off  I was still standing up recalls Roger I didnt know what else to do so I started hopping towards the goal line The referee ran over and threw his hands into the air Touchdown You know even better than the six points was the look on the face of the other kid who was holding my artificial leg Rogers love of sports grew and so did his self confidence But not every obstacle gave way to Rogers determination Eating in the lunchroom with the other kids watching him fumble with his food proved very painful to Roger as did his repeated failure in typing class I learned a very good lesson from typing class said Roger You cant do everythingits better to concentrate on what you can do One thing Roger could do was swing a tennis racket Unfortunately when he swung it hard his weak grip usually launched it into space By luck Roger stumbled upon an oddlooking tennis racket in a sports shop and accidentally wedged his finger between its doublebarred handle when he picked it up The snug fit made it possible for Roger to swing serve and volley like an ablebodied player He practiced every day and was soon playingand losingmatches But Roger persisted He practiced and practiced and played and played Surgery on the two fingers of his left hand enabled Roger to grip his special racket better greatly improving his game Although he had no role models to guide him Roger became obsessed with tennis and in time he started to win Roger went on to play college tennis finishing his tennis career with 22 wins and 11 losses He later became the first physically handicapped tennis player to be certified as a teaching professional by the United States Professional Tennis Association Roger now tours the country speaking to groups about what it takes to be a winner no matter who you are The only difference between you and me is that you can see my handicap but I cant see yours We all have them When people ask me how Ive been able to overcome my physical handicaps I tell them that I havent overcome anything Ive simply learned what I cant dosuch as play the piano or eat with chopsticksbut more importantly Ive learned what I can do Then I do what I can with all my heart and soul Jack Canfield  Yes You Can Experience is not what happens to a man It is what a man does with what happens to him Aldous Huxley What if at age 46 you were burned beyond recognition in a terrible motorcycle accident and then four years later were paralyzed from the waist down in an airplane crash Then can you imagine yourself becoming a millionaire a respected public speaker a happy newlywed and a successful business person Can you see yourself going white water rafting Sky diving Running for political office W Mitchell has done all these things and more after two horrible accidents left his face a quilt of multicolored skin grafts his hands fingerless and his legs thin and motionless in a wheelchair The 16 surgeries Mitchell endured after the motorcycle accident burned more than 65 percent of his body left him unable to pick up a fork dial a telephone or go to the bathroom without help But Mitchell a former Marine never believed he was defeated I am in charge of my own spaceship he said Its my up my down I could choose to see this situation as a setback or a starting point Six months later he was piloting a plane again Mitchell bought himself a Victorian home in Colorado some real estate a plane and a bar Later he teamed up with two friends and cofounded a woodburning stove company that grew to be Vermonts second largest private employer Then four years after the motorcycle accident the plane Mitchell was piloting crashed back onto the runway during takeoff crushing Mitchells 12 thoracic vertebra and permanently paralyzing him from the waist down I wondered what the hell was happening to me What did I do to deserve this Undaunted Mitchell worked day and night to regain as much independence as possible He was elected Mayor of Crested Butte Colorado to save the town from mineral mining that would ruin its beauty and environment Mitchell later ran for Congress turning his odd appearance into an asset with slogans such as Not just another pretty face Despite his initially shocking looks and physical challenges Mitchell began white water rafting he fell in love and married earned a masters  degree in public administration and continued flying environmental activism and public speaking Mitchells unshakable Positive Mental Attitude has earned him appearances on the Today Show and Good Morning America as well as feature articles in Parade Time The New York Times and other publications Before I was paralyzed there were 10000 things I could do Mitchell says Now there are 9000 I can either dwell on the 1000 I lost or focus on the 9000 I have left I tell people that I have had two big bumps in my life If I have chosen not to use them as an excuse to quit then maybe some of the experiences you are having which are pulling you back can be put into a new perspective You can step back take a wider view and have a chance to say Maybe that isnt such a big deal after all Remember Its not what happens to you its what you do about it Jack Canfield and Mark V Hansen  Run Patti Run At a young and tender age Patti Wilson was told by her doctor that she was an epileptic Her father Jim Wilson is a morning jogger One day she smiled through her teenage braces and said Daddy what Id really love to do is run with you every day but Im afraid Ill have a seizure Her father told her If you do I know how to handle it so lets start running Thats just what they did every day It was a wonderful experience for them to share and there were no seizures at all while she was running After a few weeks she told her father Daddy what Id really love to do is break the worlds longdistance running record for women Her father checked the Guiness Book of World Records and found that the farthest any woman had run was 80 miles As a freshman in high school Patti announced Im going to run from Orange County up to San Francisco A distance of 400 miles As a sophomore she went on Im going to run to Portland Oregon Over 1500 miles As a junior Ill run to St Louis About 2000 miles As a senior Ill run to the White House More than 3000 miles away In view of her handicap Patti was as ambitious as she was enthusiastic but she said she looked at the handicap of being an epileptic as simply an inconvenience She focused not on what she had lost but on what she had left That year she completed her run to San Francisco wearing a Tshirt that read I Love Epileptics Her dad ran every mile at her side and her mom a nurse followed in a motor home behind them in case anything went wrong In her sophomore year Pattis classmates got behind her They built a giant poster that read Run Patti Run This has since become her motto and the title of a book she has written On her second marathon en route to Portland she fractured a bone in her foot A doctor told her she had to stop her run He said Ive got to put a cast on your ankle so that you dont sustain permanent damage Doc you dont understand she said This isnt just a whim of mine its a magnificent obsession Im not just doing it for me Im doing it to break the chains on the brains that limit so many others Isnt there a way I can keep running He gave her one option He could wrap it in adhesive instead of putting it in a cast He warned her that it would be  incredibly painful and he told her It will blister She told the doctor to wrap it up She finished the run to Portland completing her last mile with the governor of Oregon You may have seen the headlines Super Runner Patti Wilson Ends Marathon For Epilepsy On Her 17th Birthday After four months of almost continuous running from the West Coast to the East Coast Patti arrived in Washington and shook the hand of the President of the United States She told him I wanted people to know that epileptics are normal human beings with normal lives I told this story at one of my seminars not long ago and afterward a big tearyeyed man came up to me stuck out his big meaty hand and said Mark my name is Jim Wilson You were talking about my daughter Patti Because of her noble efforts he told me enough money had been raised to open up 19 multimilliondollar epileptic centers around the country If Patti Wilson can do so much with so little what can you do to outperform yourself in a state of total wellness Mark V Hansen  The Power Of Determination The little country schoolhouse was heated by an oldfashioned potbellied coal stove A little boy had the job of coming to school early each day to start the fire and warm the room before his teacher and his classmates arrived One morning they arrived to find the schoolhouse engulfed in flames They dragged the unconscious little boy out of the flaming building more dead than alive He had major burns over the lower half of his body and was taken to the nearby county hospital From his bed the dreadfully burned semiconscious little boy faintly heard the doctor talking to his mother The doctor told his mother that her son would surely diewhich was for the best reallyfor the terrible fire had devastated the lower half of his body But the brave boy didnt want to die He made up his mind that he would survive Somehow to the amazement of the physician he did survive When the mortal danger was past he again heard the doctor and his mother speaking quietly The mother was told that since the fire had destroyed so much flesh in the lower part of his body it would almost be better if he had died since he was doomed to be a lifetime cripple with no use at all of his lower limbs Once more the brave boy made up his mind He would not be a cripple He would walk But unfortunately from the waist down he had no motor ability His thin legs just dangled there all but lifeless Ultimately he was released from the hospital Every day his mother would massage his little legs but there was no feeling no control nothing Yet his determination that he would walk was as strong as ever When he wasnt in bed he was confined to a wheelchair One sunny day his mother wheeled him out into the yard to get some fresh air This day instead of sitting there he threw himself from the chair He pulled himself across the grass dragging his legs behind him He worked his way to the white picket fence bordering their lot With great effort he raised himself up on the fence Then stake by stake he began dragging himself along the fence resolved that he would walk He started to do this every day until he wore a smooth path all around the yard beside the fence There was nothing he wanted more than to develop life in those legs  Ultimately through his daily massages his iron persistence and his resolute determination he did develop the ability to stand up then to walk haltingly then to walk by himselfand thento run He began to walk to school then to run to school to run for the sheer joy of running Later in college he made the track team Still later in Madison Square Garden this young man who was not expected to survive who would surely never walk who could never hope to runthis determined young man Dr Glenn Cunningham ran the worlds fastest mile Burt Dubin  The Power Of Optimism The years of the Vietnam War were a confused troubled time for American foreign policy making the suffering of the participants all the more tragic But out of it has come the marvelous story about Captain Gerald L Coffee His plane was shot down over the China Sea on February 31966 and he spent the next seven years in a succession of prison camps The POWs who survived he says did so by a regimen of physical exercise prayer and stubborn communication with one another After days of torture on the Vietnamese version of the rack he signed the confession they demanded Then he was thrown back into his cell to writhe in pain Even worse was his guilt over having cracked He did not know if there were other American prisoners in the cell block but then he heard a voice Man in cell number 6 with the broken arm can you hear me It was Col Robinson Risner Its safe to talk Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel he said Colonel any word about my navigator Bob Hansen Coffee asked No Listen Jerry you must learn to communicate by tapping on the walls Its the only dependable link we have to each other Risner had said we That meant there were others Thank God now Im back with the others Coffee thought Have they tortured you Jerry Risner asked Yes And I feel terrible that they got anything out of me Listen Risner said once they decide to break a man they do it The important thing is how you come back Just follow the Code Resist to the utmost of your ability If they break you just dont stay broken Lick your wounds and bounce back Talk to someone if you can Dont get down on yourself We need to take care of one another For days at a time Coffee would be punished for some minor infraction by being stretched on the ropes His buddy in the next cell would tap on the wall telling him to hang tough that he was praying for him Then when he was being punished Coffee says I would be on the wall doing the same for him At last Coffee received a letter from his wife Dear Jerry It has been a beautiful spring but of course we miss you The kids are doing great Kim skis all the way around the lake now The boys swim  and dive off the dock and little Jerry splashes around with a plastic bubble on his back Coffee stopped reading because his eyes were filling with tears as he clutched his wifes letter to his chest Little Jerry Whos Jerry Then he realized Their baby born after his imprisonment had been a son and she had named him Jerry There was no way she could know that all her previous letters had been undelivered so she talked about their new son matter offactly Coffee says Holding her letter I was full of emotions relief at finally knowing that the family was well sorrow for missing out on Jerrys entire first year gratitude for the blessing of simply being alive The letter concluded All of us plus so many others are praying for your safety and return soon Take good care of yourself honey I love you Bea Coffee tells about the long long hours during which the prisoners played movies in their minds of going from room to room in their houses back home the camera taking in every detail Over and over they played scenes of what it was going to be like to be back Coffee says it was his friends and his faith that helped him through Every Sunday the senior officer in each cell block would pass a signal church call Every man stood up in his cell if he was able and then with a semblance of togetherness they would recite the TwentyThird Psalm Thou prepares a table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over Coffee says I realized that despite being incarcerated in this terrible place it was my cup that runneth over because someday however whenever I would return to a beautiful and free country Finally the peace treaty was signed and on February 3 1973 the seventh anniversary of his capture Coffee was called before two young Vietnamese officers Today it is our duty to return your belongings one said What belongings he asked This He swallowed hard and reached for the gold wedding band the soldier held between his thumb and forefinger Yes it was his He slipped it onto his finger A little loose but definitely his ring He had never expected to see it again My kids were 11 or 12 years old when my ring had been taken away Suddenly I felt old and weary During the prime years of my life I had  sat in a medieval dungeon had my arm screwed up had contracted worms and God knows what else I wondered if my children now older and changed so much would accept me back into the family and what our reunion would be like And I thought of Bea Would I be okay for her Did she still love me Could she possibly know how much she had meant to me all these years The bus trip to the Hanoi airport was a blur but one thing stood out with clarity for Coffee The bright beautiful red white and blue flag painted on the tail of the enormous Air Force C141 transport that gleamed in the sun awaiting the first load of freed prisoners Next to the aircraft were several dozen American military people who smiled at them through the fence and gave them the thumbsup signal As they lined up by twos the Vietnamese officer reeled off their names rank and service Commander Gerald L Coffee United States Navy He had been promoted two ranks in his absence As Coffee stepped forward his attention was riveted on an American colonel wearing crisp Air Force blues wings and ribbons It was the first American military uniform he had seen in many years The colonel returned Coffees brisk salute Commander Gerald L Coffee reporting for duty sir Welcome back Jerry The colonel reached forward with both hands and shook Coffees hand When the plane was loaded the pilot taxied directly onto the runway without holding short then locked the brakes and jammed his throttles forward The huge beast rocked and vibrated as the pilot made his final checks of the engines performance The roar was horrendous as the brakes were released and they lurched forward on the runway When they were airborne the pilots voice came onto the speaker and filled the cabin It was a strong sure voice Congratulations gentlemen Weve just left North Vietnam Only then did they erupt into cheers The first leg of their trip home took them to Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines The crowd held up banners Welcome Home We love you God bless From behind the security lines they applauded wildly as the name of each debarking POW was announced There were television cameras but the men had no idea that at that very moment in the small hours of the morning millions of Americans back home were riveted to their television sets cheering and weeping  Special telephones had been set up to accommodate their initial calls home Coffees stomach churned as he waited the interminable few seconds for Bea to pick up the phone in Sanford Florida where she and the children were waiting Hello babe Its me Can you believe it Hi honey Yes We watched you on TV when you came off the airplane I think everybody in America saw you You look great I dunno Im kinda scrawny But Im okay Im just anxious to get home After his longawaited reunion with his wife and children he and his family attended mass the following Sunday Afterwards in response to the parish priests welcome here is what Coffee said It summarizes as well as anything I know of the optimists code Faith was really the key to my survival all those years Faith in myself to simply pursue my duty to the best of my ability and ultimately return home with honor Faith in my fellow man starting with all of you here knowing you would be looking out for my family and faith in my comrades in those various cells and cell blocks in prison men upon whom I depended and who in turn depended upon me sometimes desperately Faith in my country its institutions and our national purpose and cause And of course faith in Godtruly as all of you know the foundation for it all Our lives are a continuing journey and we must learn and grow at every bend as we make our way sometimes stumbling but always moving toward the finest within us David McNally From The Power of Optimism by Alan boy McGinnis  Faith Were a rugged breed us quads If we werent we wouldnt be around today Yes were a rugged breed In many ways weve been blessed with a savvy and spirit that isnt given to everybody And let me say that this refusal of total or full acceptance of ones disability all hooks up with one thingfaith an almost divine faith Down in the reception room of the Institute of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation over on the East River at 400 East 34th Street in New York City theres a bronze plaque thats riveted to the wall During the months of coming back to the Institute for treatmenttwo or three times a weekI rolled through that reception room many times coming and going But I never quite made the time to pull over to one side and read the words on that plaque that were written its said by an unknown Confederate soldier Then one afternoon I did I read it and then I read it again When I finished it for the second time I was near to bursting not in despair but with an inner glow that had me straining to grip the arms of my wheelchair Id like to share it with you A Creed For Those Who Have Suffered I asked God for strength that I might achieve I was made weak that I might learn humbly to obey  I asked for health that I might do great things I was given infirmity that I might do better things  I asked for riches that I might be happy I was given poverty that I might be wise  I asked for power that I might have the praise of men I was given weakness that I might feel the need of God  I asked for all things that I might enjoy life I was given life that I might enjoy all things  I got nothing I asked forbut everything I had hoped for Almost despite myself my unspoken prayers were answered I am among men most richly blessed Roy Campanella  She Saved 219 Lives Mrs Betty Tisdale is a worldclass heroine When the war in Vietnam heated up back in April of 1975 she knew she had to save the 400 orphans who were about to be put on the streets She had already adopted five orphaned Vietnamese girls with her former pediatrician husband Col Patrick Tisdale who was a widower and already had five children As a US Naval doctor in Vietnam in 1954 Tom Dooley had helped refugees flee from the communist north Betty says I really feel Tom Dooley was a saint His influence changed my life forever Because of Dooleys book she took her life savings and traveled to Vietnam 14 times on her vacations to visit and work in the hospitals and orphanages he had founded While in Saigon she fell in love with the orphans at An Lac Happy Place run by Madame Vu Thi Ngai who was later evacuated by Betty the day Vietnam fell and returned with her to Georgia to live with Betty and her ten children When Betty a doitnow and inventsolutionsasproblemsarise kind of person realized the 400 childrens plight she went into warpspeed action She called Madame Ngai and said Yes Ill come and get the children and get them all adopted She didnt know how she would do it She just knew that shed do it Later in a movie of the evacuation The Children of An Lac Shirley Jones portrayed Betty In moments she began to move mountains She raised the necessary money in many different ways even including accepting green stamps She simply decided to do it and she did it She said I visualized all those babies growing up in good Christian homes in America not under communism That kept her motivated She left for Vietnam from Fort Benning Georgia on Sunday arrived on Tuesday in Saigon and miraculously and sleeplessly conquered every obstacle to airlift 400 children out of Saigon by Saturday morning However upon her arrival the head of Vietnams social welfare Dr Dan suddenly announced he would only approve children under ten years old and all the children must have birth certificates She quickly discovered war orphans are fortunate to simply be alive They dont have birth certificates Betty went to the hospital pediatric department obtained 225 birth certificates and quickly created birth dates times and places for the 219 eligible babies toddlers and youngsters She says I have no idea when  where and to whom they were born My fingers just created birth certificates Birth certificates were the only hope they had to depart the place safely and have a viable future with freedom It was now or never Now she needed a place to house the orphans once they were evacuated  The military at Ft Benning resisted but Betty brilliantly and tenaciously persisted Try as she might she could not get the Commanding General on the phone so she called the office of the Secretary of the Army Bo Callaway His duty too was not answering Bettys calls no matter how urgent and of lifesaving importance they were However Betty was not to be beaten She had come too far and done too much to be stopped now So since he was from Georgia she called his mother and pleaded her case Betty enrolled her with her heart and asked her to intercede Virtually overnight the Secretary of the Army her son responded and arranged that a school at Ft Benning be used as the interim home for the orphans of An Lac But the challenge of how to get the children out was still to be accomplished When Betty arrived in Saigon she went to Ambassador Graham Martin immediately and pleaded for some sort of transportation for the children She had tried to charter a Pan Am plane but Lloyds of London had raised the insurance so high that it was impossible to negotiate at this time The Ambassador agreed to help if all the papers were cleared through the Vietnamese government Dr Dan signed the last manifest literally as the children were boarding the two airforce planes The orphans were malnourished and sickly Most had never been away from the orphanage They were scared She had recruited soldiers and the ABC crew to help strap them in transport them and feed them You cant believe how deeply and permanently those volunteers hearts were touched that beautiful Saturday as 219 children were transported to freedom Every volunteer cried with joy and appreciation that they had tangibly contributed to anothers freedom Chartering airlines home from the Philippines was a huge hassle There was a 21000 expense for a United Airlines plane Dr Tisdale guaranteed payment because of his love for the orphans Had Betty had more time she could have probably got it for free But time was a factor so she moved quickly Every child was adopted within one month of arriving in the United States The Tressler Lutheran Agency in York Pennsylvania which  specializes in getting handicapped children adopted found a home for each orphan Betty has proven over and over again that you can do anything at all if you are simply willing to ask to not settle for a no to do whatever it takes and to persevere As Dr Tom Dooley once said It takes ordinary people to do extraordinary things Jack Canfield and Mark V Hansen  Are You Going To Help Me In 1989 an 82 earthquake almost flattened Armenia killing over 30000 people in less than four minutes In the midst of utter devastation and chaos a father left his wife securely at home and rushed to the school where his son was supposed to be only to discover that the building was as flat as a pancake After the traumatic initial shock he remembered the promise he had made to his son No matter what Ill always be there for you And tears began to fill his eyes As he looked at the pile of debris that once was the school it looked hopeless but he kept remembering his commitment to his son He began to concentrate on where he walked his son to class at school each morning Remembering his sons classroom would be in the back right corner of the building he rushed there and started digging through the rubble As he was digging other forlorn parents arrived clutching their hearts saying My son My daughter Other well meaning parents tried to pull him off of what was left of the school saying Its too late Theyre dead You cant help Go home Come on face reality theres nothing you can do Youre just going to make things worse To each parent he responded with one line Are you going to help me now And then he proceeded to dig for his son stone by stone The fire chief showed up and tried to pull him off of the schools debris saying Fires are breaking out explosions are happening everywhere Youre in danger Well take care of it Go home To which this loving caring Armenian father asked Are you going to help me now The police came and said Youre angry distraught and its over Youre endangering others Go home Well handle it To which he replied Are you going to help me now No one helped Courageously he proceeded alone because he needed to know for himself Is my boy alive or is he dead He dug for eight hours 12 hours 24 hours 36 hours then in the 38th hour he pulled back a boulder and heard his sons voice He  screamed his sons name ARMANDHe heard back Dad Its me Dad I told the other kids not to worry I told em that if you were alive youd save me and when you saved me theyd be saved You promised No matter what Ill always be there for you You did it Dad Whats going on in there How is it the father asked There are 14 of us left out of 33 Dad Were scared hungry thirsty and thankful youre here When the building collapsed it made a wedge like a triangle and it saved us Come on out boy No Dad Let the other kids out first cause I know youll get me No matter what I know youll be there for me Mark V Hansen  Just One More Time Theres a 19thcentury English novel set in a small Welsh town in which every year for the past 500 years the people all gather in church on Christmas Eve and pray Shortly before midnight they light candle lanterns and singing carols and hymns they walk down a country path several miles to an old abandoned stone shack There they set up a creche scene complete with manger And in simple piety they kneel and pray Their hymns warm the chilly December air Everyone in town capable of walking is there There is a myth in that town a belief that if all citizens are present on Christmas Eve and if all are praying with perfect faith then and only then at the stroke of midnight the Second Coming will be at hand And for 500 years theyve come to that stone ruin and prayed Yet the Second Coming has eluded them One of the main characters in this novel is asked Do you believe that He will come again on Christmas Eve in our town No he answers shaking his head sadly no I dont Then why do you go each year he asked Ah he says smiling what if I were the only one who wasnt there when it happened Well thats very little faith he has isnt it But it is some faith As it says in the New Testament we need only have faith as small as a grain of mustard seed to get into the Kingdom of Heaven And sometimes when we work with disturbed children atrisk youth troubled teens alcoholic or abusive or depressed and suicidal partners friends or clients it is at those moments that we need that small bit of faith that kept that man coming back to the stone ruin on Christmas Eve Just one more time Just this next time perhaps Ill make the breakthrough then We sometimes are called upon to work with people for whom others have abandoned all hope Perhaps we have even come to the conclusion that theres no possibility of change or growth Its at that time that if we can find the tiniest scrap of hope we may turn the corner achieve a measurable gain save someone worth saving Please go back my friend just this one more time Hanoch McCarty  There Is Greatness All Around You Use It There are many people who could be Olympic champions AilAmericans who have never tried Id estimate five million people could have beaten me in the pole vault the years I won it at least five million Men who were stronger bigger and faster than I was could have done it but they never picked up a pole never made the feeble effort to pick their legs off the ground to try to get over the bar Greatness is all around us Its easy to be great because great people will help you What is fantastic about all the conventions I go to is that the greatest in the business will come and share their ideas their methods and their techniques with everyone else I have seen the greatest salesmen open up and show young salesmen exactly how they did it They dont hold back I have also found it true in the world of sports Ill never forget the time I was trying to break Dutch WarmerDams record I was about a foot below his record so I called him on the phone I said Dutch can you help me I seem to have leveled off I cant get any higher He said Sure Bob come on up to visit me and Ill give you all I got I spent three days with the master the greatest pole vaulter in the world For three days Dutch gave me everything that hed seen There were things that I was doing wrong and he corrected them To make a long story short I went up eight inches That great guy gave me the best that he had Ive found that sports champions and heroes willingly do this just to help you become great too John Wooden the great UCLA basketball coach has a philosophy that every day he is supposed to help someone who can never reciprocate Thats his obligation When in college working on his masters thesis on scouting and defensive football George Allen wrote up a 30page survey and sent it out to the great coaches in the country Eightyfive percent answered it completely Great people will share which is what made George Allen one of the greatest football coaches in the world Great people will tell you their secrets Look for them call them on the phone or buy their books Go where they are get around them talk to them It is easy to be great when you get around great people Bob Richards Olympic Athlete  ECLECTIC WISDOM This life is a test It is only a test Had it been an actual life You would have received Further instructions on Where to go and what to do Found on a bulletin board Youve Got Yourself A Deal When Marita was 13 it was the era of tiedyed Tshirts and frayed jeans Even though I had grown up in the Depression and had no money for clothes I had never dressed this poorly One day I saw her out in the driveway rubbing the hems of her new jeans with dirt and rocks I was aghast at her ruining these pants I had just paid for and ran out to tell her so She continued to grind on as I recounted my soap opera of childhood deprivation As I concluded without having moved her to tears of repentance I asked why she was wrecking her new jeans She replied without looking up You cant wear new ones Why not You just cant so Im messing them up to make them look old Such total loss of logic How could it be the style to ruin new clothes Each morning as she would leave for school I would stare at her and sigh My daughter looking like that There shed stand in her fathers old Tshirt tiedyed with big blue spots and streaks Fit for a duster I thought And those jeansso lowslung I feared if she took a deep breath theyd drop off her rear But where would they go They were so tight and stiff they couldnt move The frayed bottoms helped by the rocks had strings that dragged behind her as she walked One day after she had left for school it was as if the Lord got my attention and said Do you realize what your last words are to Marita each morning My daughter looking like that When she gets to school and her friends talk about their oldfashioned mothers who complain all the time shell have your constant comments to contribute Have you ever looked at the other girls in junior high Why not give them a glance I drove over to pick her up that day and observed that many of the other girls looked even worse On the way home I mentioned how I had over  reacted to her ruining her jeans I offered a compromise From now on you can wear anything you want to school and with your friends and I wont bug you about it Thatll be a relief But when I take you out with me to church or shopping or to my friends Id like you to dress in something you know I like without my having to say a word She thought about it Then I added That means you get 95 percent your way and I get 5 percent for me What do you think She got a twinkle in her eye as she put out her hand and shook mine Mother youve got yourself a deal From then on I gave her a happy farewell in the morning and didnt bug her about her clothes When I took her out with me she dressed properly without fussing We had ourselves a deal Florence Littauer  Take A Moment To Really See We have all heard the expression Remember to stop and smell the roses But how often do we really take time out of our hectic fastpaced lives to notice the world around us Too often we get caught up in our busy schedules thoughts of our next appointment the traffic or life in general to even realize there are other people nearby I am as guilty as anyone of tuning out the world in this manner especially when I am driving on Californias overcrowded streets A short time ago however I witnessed an event that showed me how being wrapped up in my own little world has kept me from being fully aware of the bigger world picture around me I was driving to a business appointment and as usual I was planning in my mind what I was going to say I came to a very busy intersection where the stoplight had just turned red All right I thought to myself I can beat the next light if I race ahead of the pack My mind and car were in auto pilot ready to go when suddenly my trance was broken by an unforgettable sight A young couple both blind were walking arminarm across this busy intersection with cars whizzing by in every direction The man was holding the hand of a little boy while the woman was clutching a baby sling to her chest obviously carrying a child Each of them had a white cane extended searching for clues to navigate them across the intersection Initially I was moved They were overcoming what I felt was one of the most feared handicapsblindness Wouldnt it be terrible to be blind I thought My thought was quickly interrupted by horror when I saw that the couple was not walking in the crosswalk but was instead veering diagonally directly toward the middle of the intersection Wthout realizing the danger they were in they were walking right smack into the path of oncoming cars I was frightened for them because I didnt know if the other drivers understood what was happening As I watched from the front line of traffic I had the best seat in the house I saw a miracle unfold before my eyes Every car in every direction came to a simultaneous stop I never heard the screech of brakes or even the peep of a car horn Nobody even yelled Get out of the way Everything froze In that moment time seemed to stand still for this family  Amazed I looked at the cars around me to verify that we were all seeing the same thing I noticed that everyones attention was also fixed on the couple Suddenly the driver to my right reacted Craning his head out of his car he yelled To your right To your right Other people followed in unison shouting To your right Never skipping a beat the couple adjusted their course as they followed the coaching Trusting their white canes and the calls from some concerned citizens they made it to the other side of the road As they arrived at the curb one thing struck methey were still arminarm I was taken aback by the emotionless expressions on their faces and judged that they had no idea what was really going on around them Yet I immediately sensed the sighs of relief exhaled by everyone stopped at that intersection As I glanced into the cars around me the driver on my right was mouthing the words Whew did you see that The driver to the left of me was saying I cant believe it I think all of us were deeply moved by what we had just witnessed Here were human beings stepping outside themselves for a moment to help four people in need I have reflected back on this situation many times since it happened and have learned several powerful lessons from it The first is Slow down and smell the roses Something I had rarely done up until then Take time to look around and really see what is going on in front of you right now Do this and you will realize that this moment is all there is more importantly this moment is all that you have to make a difference in life The second lesson I learned is that the goals we set for ourselves can be attained through faith in ourselves and trust in others despite seemingly insurmountable obstacles The blind couples goal was simply to get to the other side of the road intact Their obstacle was eight lines of cars aimed straight at them Yet without panic or doubt they walked forward until they reached their goal We too can move forward in attaining our goals putting blinders on to the obstacles that would stand in our way We just need to trust our intuition and accept the guidance of others who may have greater insight Finally I learned to really appreciate my gift of sight something I had taken for granted all too often  Can you imagine how different life would be without your eyes Try to imagine for a moment walking into a busy intersection without being able to see How often we forget the simple yet incredible gifts we have in our life As I drove away from that busy intersection I did so with more awareness of life and compassion for others than I had arrived there with Since then I have made the decision to really see life as I go about my daily activities and use my Godgiven talents to help others less fortunate Do yourself a favor as you walk through life Slow down and take the time to really see Take a moment to see what is going on around you right now right where you are You may be missing something wonderful Jeffrey Michael Thomas  If I Had My Life To Live Over Interviews with the elderly and the terminally ill do not report that people have regret for the things they have done but rather people talk about the things they regret not having done Id dare to make more mistakes next time Id relax I would limber up I would be sillier than I have been this trip  I would take fewer things seriously I would take more chances I would take more trips I would climb more mountains and swim more rivers I would eat more ice cream and less beans I would perhaps have more actual troubles but Id have fewer imaginary ones You see Im one of those people who live sensibly and sanely hour after hour day after day Oh Ive had my moments and if I had it to do over again Id have more of them In fact Id try to have nothing else Just moments One after another instead of living so many years ahead of each day Ive been one of those people who never go anywhere without a thermometer a hot water bottle a raincoat and a parachute If I had it to do again I would travel lighter next time If I had my life to live over I would start barefoot earlier in the spring and stay that way later in the fall I would go to more dances I would ride more merrygorounds I would pick more daisies Nadine Stair age 85  Two Monks Two monks on a pilgrimage came to the ford of a river There they saw a girl dressed in all her finery obviously not knowing what to do since the river was high and she did not want to spoil her clothes Without more ado one of the monks took her on his back carried her across and put her down on dry ground on the other side Then the monks continued on their way But the other monk after an hour started complaining Surely it is not right to touch a woman it is against the commandments to have close contact with women How could you go against the rules of monks The monk who had carried the girl walked along silently but finally he remarked I set her down by the river an hour ago why are you still carrying her Irmgard Schloegl Sachi Soon after her brother was born little Sachi began to ask her parents to leave her alone with the new baby They worried that like most fouryearolds she might feel jealous and want to hit or shake him so they said no But she showed no signs of jealousy She treated the baby with kindness and her pleas to be left alone with him became more urgent They decided to allow it Elated she went into the babys room and shut the door but it opened a crackenough for her curious parents to peek in and listen They saw little Sachi walk quietly up to her baby brother put her face close to his and say quietly Baby tell me what God feels like Im starting to forget Dan Millman  The Dolphins Gift I was in about 40 feet of water alone I knew I should not have gone alone but I was very competent and just took a chance There was not much current and the water was so warm clear and enticing When I got a cramp I realized at once how foolish I was I was not too alarmed but was completely doubled up with stomach cramps I tried to remove my weight belt but I was so doubled up I could not get to the catch I was sinking and began to feel more frightened unable to move I could see my watch and knew there was only a little more time on the tank before I would be out of air I tried to massage my abdomen I wasnt wearing a wet suit but couldnt straighten out and couldnt get to the cramped muscles with my hands I thought I cant go like this I have things to do I just couldnt die anonymously this way with no one to even know what happened to me I called out in my mind Somebody something help me I was not prepared for what happened Suddenly I felt a prodding from behind me under the armpit I thought Oh no sharks I felt real terror and despair But my arm was being lifted forcibly Around into my field of vision came an eyethe most marvelous eye I could ever imagine I swear it was smiling It was the eye of a big dolphin Looking into that eye I knew I was safe It moved farther forward nudging under and hooking its dorsal fin below my armpit with my arm over its back I relaxed hugging it flooded with relief I felt that the animal was conveying security to me that it was healing me as well as lifting me toward the surface My stomach cramps went away as we ascended and I relaxed with security but I felt very strongly that it healed me too At the surface it drew me all the way into shore It took me into water so shallow that I began to be concerned that it might be beached and I pushed it back a little deeper where it waited watching me I guess to see if I was all right It felt like another lifetime When I took off the weight belt and oxygen tank I just took everything off and went naked back into the ocean to the dolphin I felt so light and free and alive and just wanted to play in the sun and the water in all that freedom The dolphin took me back out  and played around in the water with me I noticed that there were a lot of dolphins there farther out After a while it brought me back to shore I was very tired then almost collapsing and he made sure I was safe in the shallowest water Then he turned sideways with one eye looking into mine We stayed that way for what seemed like a very long time timeless I guess in a trance almost with personal thoughts from the past going through my mind Then he made just one sound and went out to join the others And all of them left Elizabeth Gawain  The Touch Of The Masters Hand Twas battered and scarred and the auctioneer Thought it scarcely worth his while To waste much time on the old violin But held it up with a smile What am I bidden good folks he cried Wholl start the bidding for me A dollar a dollar then two Only two Two dollars and wholl make it three Three dollars once three dollars twice Going for three But no From the room far back a grayhaired man Came forward and picked up the bow Then wiping the dust from the old violin And tightening the loose strings He played a melody pure and sweet As a caroling angel sings The music ceased and the auctioneer With a voice that was quiet and low Said What am I bid for the old violin And he held it up with the bow A thousand dollars and wholl make it two Two thousand And wholl make it three Three thousand once three thousand twice And going and gone said he The people cheered but some of them cried We do not quite understand What changed its worth Swift came the reply The touch of a masters hand And many a man with life out of tune And battered and scarred with sin Is auctioned cheap to the thoughtless crowd Much like the old violin A mess of potage a glass of wine A gameand he travels on He is going once and going twice Hes going and almost gone But the Master comes and the foolish crowd  Never can quite understand The worth of a soul and the change thats wrought By the touch of the Masters hand Myra B Welch  More Chicken Soup Many of the stories and poems you have read in this book were submitted by readers like
