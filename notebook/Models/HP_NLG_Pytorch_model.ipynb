the senses Snape I can tell you how to bottle fame brew glory and even put a stopper in death Snape Then again maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confident enough to not pay attention Snape Mr Potter Snape Our new celebrity Snape Tell me what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood Snape You dont know

was staring in the mirror and the next Dumbledore Ah You see only a person who wanted to find the Stone find it but not use it would be able to get it Dumbledore That is one of my more brilliant ideas Dumbledore And between you and me thats saying something Harry Does that mean with the Stone gone I mean that Voldemort can never come back Dumbledore Ah Im afraid there are ways in which he can return Dumbledore Harry do you know why Professor Quirrell couldnt bear to have you touch him Dumbledore It was because of your mother Dumbledore She sacrificed herself for you and that kind of act

Second to Mr Ronald Weasley for the best played game of chess that Hogwarts has seen these many years50 points Dumbledore And third to Mr Harry Potter for pure nerve and outstanding courage I award Gryffindor house 60 points Hermione Were tied with Slytherin Dumbledore And finally it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies but a great deal more to stand up to your friends Dumbledore I award 10 points to Neville Longbottom Dumbledore Assuming that my calculations are correct I believe that a change of direction is in order Dumbledore Gryffindor wins the House Cup Hagrid
